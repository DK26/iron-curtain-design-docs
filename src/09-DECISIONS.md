## D001: Language — Rust

**Decision:** Build the engine in Rust.

**Rationale:**
- No GC pauses (C# / .NET is OpenRA's known weakness in large battles)
- Memory safety without runtime cost
- Fearless concurrency for parallel ECS systems
- First-class WASM compilation target (browser, modding sandbox)
- Modern tooling (cargo, crates.io, clippy, miri)
- No competition in Rust RTS space — wide open field

**Why not a high-level language (C#, Python, Java)?**

The goal is to extract maximum performance from the hardware. A game engine is one of the few domains where you genuinely need every cycle — the original Red Alert was written in C and ran close to the metal, and IC should too. High-level languages with garbage collectors, runtime overhead, and opaque memory layouts leave performance on the table. Rust gives the same hardware access as C without the footguns.

**Why not C/C++?**

Beyond the well-known safety and tooling arguments: **C++ is a liability in the age of LLM-assisted development.** This project is built with agentic LLMs as a core part of the development workflow. With Rust, LLM-generated code that compiles is overwhelmingly *correct* — the borrow checker, type system, and ownership model catch entire categories of bugs at compile time. The compiler is a safety net that makes LLM output trustworthy. With C++, LLM-generated code that compiles can still contain use-after-free, data races, undefined behavior, and subtle memory corruption — bugs that are dangerous precisely because they're silent. The errors are cryptic, the debugging is painful, and the risk compounds as the codebase grows. Rust's compiler turns the LLM from a risk into a superpower: you can develop faster and bolder because the guardrails are structural, not optional.

This isn't a temporary advantage. LLM-assisted development is the future of programming. Choosing a language where the compiler verifies LLM output — rather than one where you must manually audit every line for memory safety — is a strategic bet that compounds over the lifetime of the project.

**Why Rust is the right moment for a C&C engine:**

Rust is replacing C and C++ across the industry. It's in the Linux kernel, Android, Windows, Chromium, and every major cloud provider's infrastructure. The ecosystem is maturing rapidly — crates.io has 150K+ crates, Bevy is the most actively developed open-source game engine in any language, and the community is growing faster than any systems language since C++ itself. Serious new infrastructure projects increasingly start in Rust rather than C++.

This creates a unique opportunity for a C&C engine renewal. The original games were written in C. OpenRA chose C# — a reasonable choice in 2007, but one that traded hardware performance for developer productivity. Rust didn't exist as a viable option then. It does now. A Rust-native engine can match C's performance, exceed C#'s safety, leverage Rust's excellent concurrency model to use all available CPU cores, and tap into a modern ecosystem (Bevy, wgpu, serde, tokio) that simply has no C++ equivalent at the same quality level. The timing is right: Rust is mature enough to build on, young enough that the RTS space is wide open, and the C&C community deserves an engine built with the best tools available today.

**Alternatives considered:**
- C++ (manual memory management, no safety guarantees, build system pain, dangerous with LLM-assisted workflows — silent bugs where Rust would catch them at compile time)
- C# (would just be another OpenRA — no differentiation, GC pauses in hot paths, gives up hardware-level performance)
- Zig (too immature ecosystem for this scope)

---

## D002: Framework — Bevy (REVISED from original "No Bevy" decision)

**Decision:** Use Bevy as the game framework.

**Original decision:** Custom library stack (winit + wgpu + hecs). This was overridden.

**Why the reversal:**
- The 2-4 months building engine infrastructure (sprite batching, cameras, audio, input, asset pipeline, hot reload) is time NOT spent on the sim, netcode, and modding — the things that differentiate this project
- Bevy's ECS IS our architecture — no "fighting two systems." OpenRA traits map directly to Bevy components
- `FixedUpdate` + `.chain()` gives deterministic sim scheduling natively
- Bevy's plugin system makes pluggable networking cleaner than the original trait-based design
- Headless mode (`MinimalPlugins`) for dedicated servers is built in
- WASM/browser target is tested by community
- `bevy_reflect` enables advanced modding capabilities
- Breaking API changes are manageable: pin version per phase, upgrade between phases

**Risk mitigation:**
- Breaking changes → version pinning per development phase
- Not isometric-specific → build isometric layer on Bevy's 2D (still less work than raw wgpu)
- Performance concerns → Bevy uses rayon internally, `par_iter()` for data parallelism, and allows custom render passes and SIMD where needed

**Alternatives considered:**

*Godot (rejected):*

Godot is a mature, MIT-licensed engine with excellent tooling (editor, GDScript, asset pipeline). However, it does not fit IC's architecture:

| Requirement                      | Bevy                                                                    | Godot                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Language (D001)                  | Rust-native — IC systems are Bevy systems, no boundary crossing         | C++ engine. Rust logic via GDExtension adds a C ABI boundary on every engine call                |
| ECS for 500+ units               | Flat archetypes, cache-friendly iteration, `par_iter()`                 | Scene tree (node hierarchy). Hundreds of RTS units as Nodes fight cache coherence. No native ECS |
| Deterministic sim (Invariant #1) | `FixedUpdate` + `.chain()` — explicit, documented system ordering       | `_physics_process()` order depends on scene tree position — harder to guarantee across versions  |
| Headless server                  | `MinimalPlugins` — zero rendering, zero GPU dependency                  | Can run headless but designed around rendering. Heavier baseline                                 |
| Crate structure                  | Each `ic-*` crate is a Bevy plugin. Clean `Cargo.toml` dependency graph | Each module would be a GDExtension shared library with C ABI marshalling overhead                |
| WASM browser target              | Community-tested. Rust code compiles to WASM directly                   | WASM export includes the entire C++ runtime (~40 MB+)                                            |
| Modding (D005)                   | WASM mods call host functions directly. Lua via `mlua` in-process       | GDExtension → C ABI → Rust → WASM chain. Extra indirection                                       |
| Fixed-point math (D009)          | Systems operate on IC's `i32`/`i64` types natively                      | Physics uses `float`/`double` internally. IC would bypass engine math entirely                   |

Using Godot would mean writing all simulation logic in Rust via GDExtension, bypassing Godot's physics/math/networking, building a custom editor anyway (D038), and using none of GDScript. At that point Godot becomes expensive rendering middleware with a C ABI tax — Bevy provides the same rendering capabilities (wgpu) without the boundary. Godot's strengths (mature editor, GDScript rapid prototyping, scene tree composition) serve adventure and platformer games well but are counterproductive for flat ECS simulation of hundreds of units.

IC borrows interface design patterns from Godot — pluggable `MultiplayerAPI` validates IC's `NetworkModel` trait (D006), "editor is the engine" validates `ic-editor` as a Bevy app (D038), and the separate proposals repository informs governance (D037) — but these are architectural lessons, not reasons to adopt Godot as a runtime. See `research/godot-o3de-engine-analysis.md` for the full analysis.

*Custom library stack — winit + wgpu + hecs (original decision, rejected):*

The original plan avoided framework lock-in by assembling individual crates. Rejected because 2-4 months of infrastructure work (sprite batching, cameras, audio, input, asset pipeline) delays the differentiating features (sim, netcode, modding). Bevy provides all of this with a compatible ECS architecture.

## D003: Data Format — Real YAML, Not MiniYAML

**Decision:** Use standard spec-compliant YAML with `serde_yaml`. Not OpenRA's MiniYAML.

**Rationale:**
- Standard YAML parsers, linters, formatters, editor support all work
- `serde_yaml` → typed Rust struct deserialization for free
- JSON-schema validation catches errors before game loads
- No custom parser to maintain
- Inheritance resolved at load time as a processing pass, not a parser feature

**Alternatives considered:**
- MiniYAML as-is (rejected — custom parser, no tooling support, not spec-compliant)
- TOML (rejected — awkward for deeply nested game data)
- RON (rejected — modders won't know it, thin editor support)
- JSON (rejected — too verbose, no comments)

**Migration:** `miniyaml2yaml` converter tool in `ra-formats` crate.

---

## D004: Modding — Lua (Not Python) for Scripting

**Decision:** Use Lua for Tier 2 scripting. Do NOT use Python.

**Rationale against Python:**
- Floating-point non-determinism breaks lockstep multiplayer
- GC pauses (reintroduces the problem Rust solves)
- 50-100x slower than native (hot paths run every tick for every unit)
- Embedding CPython is heavy (~15-30MB)
- Sandboxing is unsolvable — security disaster for community mods

**Rationale for Lua:**
- Tiny runtime (~200KB), designed for embedding
- Deterministic (provide fixed-point bindings, avoid floats)
- Trivially sandboxable (control available functions)
- Industry standard: Factorio, WoW, Dota 2, Roblox
- `mlua`/`rlua` crates are mature
- Any modder can learn in an afternoon

---

## D005: Modding — WASM for Power Users (Tier 3)

**Decision:** WASM modules via `wasmtime`/`wasmer` for advanced mods.

**Rationale:**
- Near-native performance
- Perfectly sandboxed by design
- Deterministic execution (critical for multiplayer)
- Modders can write in Rust, C, Go, AssemblyScript, or Python-to-WASM
- Leapfrogs OpenRA (requires C# for deep mods)

---

## D006: Networking — Pluggable via Trait

**Decision:** Abstract all networking behind a `NetworkModel` trait. Game loop is generic over it.

**Rationale:**
- Sim never touches networking concerns (clean boundary)
- Full testability (run sim with `LocalNetwork`)
- Community can contribute netcode without understanding game logic
- Enables future models: rollback, client-server, cross-engine adapters
- Players could choose model in lobby

**Key invariant:** `ic-sim` has zero imports from `ic-net`. They only share `ic-protocol`.

**Cross-engine validation:** Godot's `MultiplayerAPI` trait follows the same pattern — an abstract multiplayer interface with a default `SceneMultiplayer` implementation and a null `OfflineMultiplayerPeer` for single-player/testing (which validates IC's `LocalNetwork` concept). O3DE's separate `AzNetworking` (transport layer: TCP, UDP, serialization) and `Multiplayer` Gem (game-level replication, authority, entity migration) validates IC's `ic-net` / `ic-protocol` separation. Both engines prove that trait-abstracted networking with a null/offline implementation is the industry-standard pattern for testable game networking. See `research/godot-o3de-engine-analysis.md`.

---

## D007: Networking — Relay Server as Default

**Decision:** Default multiplayer uses relay server with time authority, not pure P2P. The relay logic (`RelayCore`) is a library component in `ic-net` — it can be deployed as a standalone binary (dedicated server for hosting, server rooms, Raspberry Pi) or embedded inside a game client (listen server — "Host Game" button, zero external infrastructure). Clients connecting to either deployment use the same protocol and cannot distinguish between them.

**Rationale:**
- Blocks lag switches (server owns the clock)
- Enables sub-tick chronological ordering (CS2 insight)
- Handles NAT traversal (no port forwarding — dedicated server mode)
- Enables order validation before broadcast (anti-cheat)
- Signed replays
- Cheap to run (doesn't run sim, just forwards orders — ~2-10 KB memory per game)
- **Listen server mode:** embedded relay lets any player host a game with full sub-tick ordering and anti-lag-switch, no external server needed. Host's own orders go through the same `RelayCore` pipeline — no host advantage in order processing.
- **Dedicated server mode:** standalone binary for competitive/ranked play, community hosting, and multi-game capacity on cheap hardware.

**Trust boundary:** For ranked/competitive play, the matchmaking system requires connection to an official or community-verified dedicated relay (untrusted host can't be allowed relay authority). For casual/LAN/custom games, the embedded relay is preferred — zero setup, full relay quality.

**Validated by:** C&C Generals/Zero Hour's "packet router" — a client-side star topology where one player collected and rebroadcast all commands. IC's embedded relay improves on this pattern: the host's orders go through `RelayCore`'s sub-tick pipeline like everyone else's (no peeking, no priority), eliminating the host advantage that Generals had. The dedicated server mode further eliminates any hosting-related advantage. See `research/generals-zero-hour-netcode-analysis.md`. Further validated by Valve's GameNetworkingSockets (GNS), which defaults to relay (Valve SDR — Steam Datagram Relay) for all connections, including P2P-capable scenarios. GNS's rationale mirrors ours: relay eliminates NAT traversal headaches, provides consistent latency measurement, and blocks IP-level attacks. The GNS architecture also validates encrypting all relay traffic (AES-GCM-256 + Curve25519) — see D054 § Transport encryption. See `research/valve-github-analysis.md`. Additionally validated by Embark Studios' **Quilkin** — a production Rust UDP proxy for game servers (1,510★, Apache 2.0, co-developed with Google Cloud Gaming). Quilkin provides a concrete implementation of relay-as-filter-chain: session routing via token-based connection IDs, QCMP latency measurement for server selection, composable filter pipeline (Capture → Firewall → RateLimit → TokenRouter), and full OTEL observability. Quilkin's production deployment on Tokio + tonic confirms that async Rust handles game relay traffic at scale. See `research/embark-studios-rust-gamedev-analysis.md`.

**Alternatives available:** Pure P2P lockstep, fog-authoritative server, rollback — all implementable as `NetworkModel` variants.

---

## D008: Sub-Tick Timestamps on Orders

**Decision:** Every order carries a sub-tick timestamp. Orders within a tick are processed in chronological order.

**Rationale (inspired by CS2):**
- Fairer results for edge cases (two players competing for same resource/building)
- Trivial to implement (just attach timestamp at input layer)
- Network model preserves but doesn't depend on timestamps
- If a future model ignores timestamps, no breakage

---

## D009: Simulation — Fixed-Point Math, No Floats

**Decision:** All sim-layer calculations use integer/fixed-point arithmetic. Floats allowed only for rendering interpolation.

**Rationale:**
- Required for deterministic lockstep (floats can produce different results across platforms)
- Original Red Alert used integer math — proven approach
- OpenRA uses `WDist`/`WPos`/`WAngle` with 1024 subdivisions — same principle

---

## D010: Simulation — Snapshottable State

**Decision:** Full sim state must be serializable/deserializable at any tick.

**Rationale enables:**
- Save games (trivially)
- Replay system (initial state + orders)
- Desync debugging (diff snapshots between clients at divergence point)
- Rollback netcode (restore state N frames back, replay with corrected inputs)
- Cross-engine reconciliation (restore from authoritative checkpoint)
- Automated testing (load known state, apply inputs, verify result)

**Crash-safe serialization (from Valve Fossilize):** Save files use an append-only write strategy with a final header update — the same pattern Valve uses in Fossilize (their pipeline cache serialization library, see `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § Part 3). The payload is written first into a temporary file; only after the full payload is fsynced does the header (containing checksum + payload length) get written atomically. If the process crashes mid-write, the incomplete temporary file is detected and discarded on next load — the previous valid save remains intact. This eliminates the "corrupted save file" failure mode that plagues games with naïve serialization.

**Autosave threading:** Autosave (including `delta_snapshot()` serialization + LZ4 compression + fsync) MUST run on the dedicated I/O thread — never on the game loop thread. On a 5400 RPM HDD, the `fsync()` call alone takes 50–200 ms (waits for platters to physically commit). Even though delta saves are only ~30 KB, fsync latency dominates. The game thread's only responsibility is to produce the `DeltaSnapshot` data (reading ECS state — fast, ~0.5–1 ms for 500 units via `ChangeMask` bitfield iteration). The serialized bytes are then sent to the I/O thread via the same ring buffer used for SQLite events. The I/O thread handles file I/O + fsync asynchronously. This prevents the guaranteed 50–200 ms HDD hitch that would otherwise occur every autosave interval.

**Delta encoding for snapshots:** Periodic full snapshots (for save games, desync debugging) are complemented by **delta snapshots** that encode only changed state since the last full snapshot. Delta encoding uses property-level diffing: each ECS component that changed since the last snapshot is serialized; unchanged components are omitted. For a 500-unit game where ~10% of components change per tick, a delta snapshot is ~10x smaller than a full snapshot. This reduces save file size, speeds up autosave, and makes periodic snapshot transmission (for late-join reconnection) bandwidth-efficient. Inspired by Source Engine's `CNetworkVar` per-field change detection (see `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 2.2) and the `SPROP_CHANGES_OFTEN` priority flag — components that change every tick (position, health) are checked first during delta computation, improving cache locality. See `10-PERFORMANCE.md` for the performance impact and `09-DECISIONS.md` § D054 for the `SnapshotCodec` version dispatch.

---

## D011: Cross-Engine Play — Community Layer, Not Sim Layer

**Decision:** Cross-engine compatibility targets data/community layer. NOT bit-identical simulation.

**Rationale:**
- Bit-identical sim requires bug-for-bug reimplementation (that's a port, not our engine)
- Community interop is valuable and achievable: shared server browser, maps, mod format
- Applies equally to OpenRA and CnCNet — both are `CommunityBridge` targets (shared game browser, community discovery)
- CnCNet integration is discovery-layer only: IC games use IC relay servers (not CnCNet tunnels), IC rankings are separate (different balance, anti-cheat, match certification)
- Architecture keeps the door open for deeper interop later (OrderCodec, SimReconciler, ProtocolAdapter)
- Progressive levels: shared lobby → replay viewing → casual cross-play → competitive cross-play

---

## D012: Security — Validate Orders in Sim

**Decision:** Every order is validated inside the simulation before execution. Validation is deterministic.

**Rationale:**
- All clients run same validation → agree on rejections → no desync
- Defense in depth with relay server validation
- Repeated rejections indicate cheating (loggable)
- No separate "anti-cheat" system — validation IS anti-cheat

**Dual error reporting:** Validation produces two categories of rejection, following the pattern used by SC2's order system (see `research/blizzard-github-analysis.md` § Part 4):

1. **Immediate rejection** — the order is structurally invalid or fails preconditions that can be checked at submission time (unit doesn't exist, player doesn't own the unit, ability on cooldown, insufficient resources). The sim rejects the order before it enters the execution pipeline. All clients agree on the rejection deterministically.

2. **Late failure** — the order was valid when submitted but fails during execution (target died between order and execution, path became blocked, build site was occupied by the time construction starts). The order entered the pipeline but the action could not complete. Late failures are normal gameplay, not cheating indicators.

Only *immediate rejections* count toward suspicious-activity tracking. Late failures happen to legitimate players constantly (e.g., two allies both target the same enemy, one kills it before the other's attack lands). SC2 defines 214 distinct `ActionResult` codes for this taxonomy — IC uses a smaller set grouped by category:

```rust
pub enum OrderRejectionCategory {
    Ownership,      // unit doesn't belong to this player
    Resources,      // can't afford
    Prerequisites,  // tech tree not met
    Targeting,      // invalid target type
    Placement,      // can't build there
    Cooldown,       // ability not ready
    Transport,      // transport full / wrong passenger type
    Custom,         // game-module-defined rejection
}
```

## D013: Pathfinding — Trait-Abstracted, Multi-Layer Hybrid First

**Decision:** Pathfinding and spatial queries are abstracted behind traits (`Pathfinder`, `SpatialIndex`) in the engine core. The RA1 game module implements them with a multi-layer hybrid pathfinder and spatial hash. The engine core never calls algorithm-specific functions directly.

**Rationale:**
- OpenRA uses hierarchical A* which struggles with large unit groups and lacks local avoidance
- A multi-layer approach (hierarchical sectors + JPS/flowfield tiles + local avoidance) handles both small and mass movement well
- Grid-based implementations are the right choice for the isometric C&C family
- But pathfinding is a *game module concern*, not an engine-core assumption
- Abstracting behind a trait costs near-zero now (one trait, one impl) and prevents a rewrite if a future game module needs navmesh or any other spatial model
- Same philosophy as `NetworkModel` (build `LocalNetwork` first, but the seam exists), `WorldPos.z` (costs one `i32`, saves RA2 rewrite), and `InputSource` (build mouse/keyboard first, touch slots in later)

**Concrete design:**
- `Pathfinder` trait: `request_path()`, `get_path()`, `is_passable()`, `invalidate_area()`, `path_distance()`, `batch_distances()`
- `SpatialIndex` trait: `query_range()`, `update_position()`, `remove()`
- RA1 module registers `IcPathfinder` (primary) + `GridSpatialHash`; D045 adds `RemastersPathfinder` and `OpenRaPathfinder` as additional `Pathfinder` implementations for movement feel presets
- All sim systems call the traits, never grid-specific data structures
- See `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Pathfinding & Spatial Queries" for trait definitions

**Modder-selectable and modder-provided:** The `Pathfinder` trait is open — not locked to first-party implementations. Modders can:
1. **Select** any registered `Pathfinder` for their mod (e.g., a total conversion picks `IcPathfinder` for its smooth movement, or `RemastersPathfinder` for its retro feel)
2. **Provide** their own `Pathfinder` implementation via a Tier 3 WASM module and distribute it through the Workshop (D030)
3. **Use someone else's** community-created pathfinder — just declare it as a dependency in the mod manifest

This follows the same pattern as render modes (D048): the engine ships built-in implementations, mods can add more, and players/modders pick what they want. A Generals-clone mod ships a `LayeredGridPathfinder`; a tower defense mod ships a waypoint pathfinder; a naval mod ships something flow-based. The trait doesn't care — `request_path()` returns waypoints regardless of how they were computed.

**Performance:** identical to hardcoding. Rust traits monomorphize — the trait call compiles to a direct function call when there's one implementation. Zero overhead.

**What we build first:** `IcPathfinder` and `GridSpatialHash`. The traits exist from day one. `RemastersPathfinder` and `OpenRaPathfinder` are Phase 2 deliverables (D045) — ported from their respective GPL codebases. Community pathfinders can be published to the Workshop from Phase 6a.

---

## D014: Templating — Tera in Phase 6a (Nice-to-Have)

**Decision:** Add Tera template engine for YAML/Lua generation. Phase 6a. Not foundational.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates copy-paste for faction variants, bulk unit generation
- Load-time only (zero runtime cost)
- ~50 lines to integrate
- Optional — no mod depends on it

---

## D015: Performance — Efficiency-First, Not Thread-First

**Decision:** Performance is achieved through algorithmic efficiency, cache-friendly data layout, adaptive workload, zero allocation, and amortized computation. Multi-core scaling is a bonus layer on top, not the foundation.

**Principle:** The engine must run a 500-unit battle smoothly on a 2-core, 4GB machine from 2012. Multi-core machines get higher unit counts as a natural consequence of the work-stealing scheduler.

**The Efficiency Pyramid (ordered by impact):**
1. Algorithmic efficiency (flowfields, spatial hash, hierarchical pathfinding)
2. Cache-friendly ECS layout (hot/warm/cold component separation)
3. Simulation LOD (skip work that doesn't affect the outcome)
4. Amortized work (stagger expensive systems across ticks)
5. Zero-allocation hot paths (pre-allocated scratch buffers)
6. Work-stealing parallelism (rayon via Bevy — bonus, not foundation)

**Inspired by:** Datadog Vector's pipeline efficiency, Tokio's work-stealing runtime. These systems are fast because they waste nothing, not because they use more hardware.

**Anti-pattern rejected:** "Just parallelize it" as the default answer. Parallelism without algorithmic efficiency is adding lanes to a highway with broken traffic lights.

See `10-PERFORMANCE.md` for full details, targets, and implementation patterns.

---

## D016: LLM-Generated Missions and Campaigns

**Decision:** Provide an optional LLM-powered mission generation system (Phase 7) via the `ic-llm` crate. Players bring their own LLM provider (BYOLLM) — the engine never ships or requires one. Every game feature works fully without an LLM configured.

**Rationale:**
- Transforms Red Alert from finite content to infinite content — for players who opt in
- Generated output is standard YAML + Lua — fully editable, shareable, learnable
- No other RTS (Red Alert or otherwise) offers this capability
- LLM quality is sufficient for terrain layout, objective design, AI behavior scripting
- **Strictly optional:** `ic-llm` crate is optional, game works without it. No feature — campaigns, skirmish, multiplayer, modding, analytics — depends on LLM availability. The LLM enhances the experience; it never gates it

**Scope:**
- Phase 7: single mission generation (terrain, objectives, enemy composition, triggers, briefing)
- Phase 7: player-aware generation — LLM reads local SQLite (D034) for faction history, unit preferences, win rates, campaign roster state; injects player context into prompts for personalized missions, adaptive briefings, post-match commentary, coaching suggestions, and rivalry narratives
- Phase 7: replay-to-scenario narrative generation — LLM reads gameplay event logs from replays to generate briefings, objectives, dialogue, and story context for scenarios extracted from real matches (see D038 § Replay-to-Scenario Pipeline)
- Phase 7: **generative campaigns** — full multi-mission branching campaigns generated progressively as the player advances (see Generative Campaign Mode below)
- Phase 7: **generative media** — AI-generated voice lines, music, sound FX for campaigns and missions via pluggable provider traits (see Generative Media Pipeline below)
- Phase 7+ / Future: AI-generated cutscenes/video (depends on technology maturity)
- Future: cooperative scenario design, community challenge campaigns

> **Positioning note:** LLM features are a quiet power-user capability, not a project headline. The primary single-player story is the hand-authored branching campaign system (D021), which requires no LLM and is genuinely excellent on its own merits. LLM generation is for players who want more content — it should never appear before D021 in marketing or documentation ordering. The word “AI” in gaming contexts attracts immediate hostility from a significant audience segment regardless of implementation quality. Lead with campaigns, reveal LLM as “also, modders and power users can use AI tools if they want.”

**Implementation approach:**
- LLM generates YAML map definition + Lua trigger scripts
- Same format as hand-crafted missions — no special runtime
- Validation pass ensures generated content is playable (valid unit types, reachable objectives)
- Can use local models or API-based models (user choice)
- Player data for personalization comes from local SQLite queries (read-only) — no data leaves the device unless the user's LLM provider is cloud-based (BYOLLM architecture)

**Bring-Your-Own-LLM (BYOLLM) architecture:**
- `ic-llm` defines a `LlmProvider` trait — any backend that accepts a prompt and returns structured text
- Built-in providers: OpenAI-compatible API, local Ollama/llama.cpp, Anthropic API
- Users configure their provider in settings (API key, endpoint, model name)
- The engine never ships or requires a specific model — the user chooses
- Provider is a runtime setting, not a compile-time dependency
- All prompts and responses are logged (opt-in) for debugging and sharing
- Offline mode: pre-generated content works without any LLM connection

### Generative Campaign Mode

The single biggest use of LLM generation: **full branching campaigns created on the fly.** The player picks a faction, adjusts parameters (or accepts defaults), and the LLM generates an entire campaign — backstory, missions, branching paths, persistent characters, and narrative arc — progressively as they play. Every generated campaign is a standard D021 campaign: YAML graph, Lua scripts, maps, briefings. Once generated, a campaign is **fully playable without an LLM** — generation is the creative act; playing is standard IC.

#### How It Works

**Step 1 — Campaign Setup (one screen, defaults provided):**

The player opens "New Generative Campaign" from the main menu. If no LLM provider is configured, the button is still clickable — it opens a guidance panel: "Generative campaigns need an LLM provider to create missions. [Configure LLM Provider →] You can also browse pre-generated campaigns on the Workshop. [Browse Workshop →]" (see D033 § "UX Principle: No Dead-End Buttons"). Once an LLM is configured, the same button opens the configuration screen with defaults and an "Advanced" expander for fine-tuning:

| Parameter              | Default           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Player faction**     | (must pick)       | Soviet, Allied, or a modded faction. Determines primary enemies and narrative allegiance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Campaign length**    | 24 missions       | Total missions in the campaign arc. Configurable: 8 (short), 16 (medium), 24 (standard), 32+ (epic), or **open-ended** (no fixed count — campaign ends when victory conditions are met; see Open-Ended Campaigns below).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Branching density**  | Medium            | How many branch points. Low = mostly linear with occasional forks. High = every mission has 2–3 outcomes leading to different paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Tone**               | Military thriller | Narrative style: military thriller, pulp action, dark/gritty, campy Cold War, espionage, or freeform text description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Story style**        | C&C Classic       | Story structure and character voice. See "Story Style Presets" below. Options: C&C Classic (default — over-the-top military drama with memorable personalities), Realistic Military, Political Thriller, Pulp Sci-Fi, Character Drama, or freeform text description. Note: "Military thriller" tone + "C&C Classic" story style is the canonical pairing — they are complementary, not contradictory. C&C IS a military thriller, played at maximum volume with camp and conviction (see 13-PHILOSOPHY.md § Principle 20). The tone governs atmospheric tension; the story style governs character voice and narrative structure. |
| **Difficulty curve**   | Adaptive          | Start easy, escalate. Options: flat, escalating, adaptive (adjusts based on player performance), brutal (hard from mission 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Roster persistence** | Enabled           | Surviving units carry forward (D021 carryover). Disabled = fresh forces each mission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Named characters**   | 3–5               | How many recurring characters the LLM creates. Built using personality-driven construction (see Character Construction Principles below). These can survive, die, betray, return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Game module**        | (current)         | RA1, TD, or any installed game module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**Advanced parameters** (hidden by default):

| Parameter                   | Default             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mission variety targets** | Balanced            | Distribution of mission types: assault, defense, stealth, escort, naval, combined arms. The LLM aims for this mix but adapts based on narrative flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Faction purity**          | 90%                 | Percentage of missions fighting the opposing faction. Remainder = rogue elements of your own faction, third parties, or storyline twists (civil war, betrayal missions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Resource level**          | Standard            | Starting resources per mission. Scarce = more survival-focused. Abundant = more action-focused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Weather variation**       | Enabled             | LLM introduces weather changes across the campaign arc (D022). Arctic campaign starts mild, ends in blizzard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Workshop resources**      | Configured sources  | Which Workshop sources (D030) the LLM can pull assets from (maps, terrain packs, music, voice lines). Only resources with `ai_usage: Allow` are eligible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Custom instructions**     | (empty)             | Freeform text the player adds to every prompt. "Include lots of naval missions." "Make Tanya a villain." "Based on actual WW2 Eastern Front operations."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Moral complexity**        | Low                 | How often the LLM generates tactical dilemmas with no clean answer, and how much character personality drives the fallout. Low = straightforward objectives. Medium = occasional trade-offs with character consequences. High = genuine moral weight with long-tail consequences across missions. See "Moral Complexity Parameter" under Extended Generative Campaign Modes.                  |
| **Victory conditions**      | (fixed length only) | For open-ended campaigns: a set of conditions that define campaign victory. Examples: "Eliminate General Morrison," "Capture all three Allied capitals," "Survive 30 missions." The LLM works toward these conditions narratively — building tension, creating setbacks, escalating stakes — and generates the final mission when conditions are ripe. Ignored when campaign length is fixed. |

The player clicks "Generate Campaign" — the LLM produces the campaign skeleton before the first mission starts (typically 10–30 seconds depending on provider).

**Step 2 — Campaign Skeleton (generated once, upfront):**

Before the first mission, the LLM generates a **campaign skeleton** — the high-level arc that provides coherence across all missions:

```yaml
# Generated campaign skeleton (stored in campaign save)
generative_campaign:
  id: gen_soviet_2026-02-14_001

  # Backstory and context (fed to the LLM for every subsequent mission prompt)
  backstory: |
    The year is 1953. The Allied peace treaty has collapsed after the
    assassination of the Soviet delegate at the Vienna Conference.
    Colonel Petrov leads a reformed armored division tasked with...
  
  # Planned branch points (approximate — adjusted as the player plays)
  branch_points:
    - mission: 4
      theme: "betray or protect civilian population"
    - mission: 8
      theme: "follow orders or defy command"
    - mission: 12
      theme: "Sonya's loyalty revealed"
    - mission: 16
      theme: "ally with rogue faction or destroy them"
    - mission: 20
      theme: "mercy or ruthlessness in final push"
```

The skeleton is a plan, not a commitment. The LLM adapts it as the player makes choices and encounters different outcomes. Act 2's betrayal might happen in mission 10 or mission 14 depending on how the player's story unfolds.

#### Character Construction Principles

Generative campaigns live or die on character quality. A procedurally generated mission with a mediocre map is forgettable. A procedurally generated mission where a character you care about betrays you is unforgettable. The LLM's system prompt includes explicit character construction guidance drawn from proven storytelling principles.

**Personality-first construction:**

Every named character is built from a personality model, not just a role label. The LLM assigns each character:

| Field            | Purpose                                                                                             | Example (Sonya)                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MBTI type**    | Governs decision-making patterns, stress reactions, communication style, and interpersonal dynamics | ENTJ — ambitious strategist who leads from the front and challenges authority |
| **Core traits**  | 3–5 adjectives that define the character's public-facing personality                                | Brilliant, ambitious, morally flexible                                        |
| **Flaw**         | A specific weakness that creates dramatic tension and makes the character human                     | Believes the ends always justify the means                                    |
| **Desire**       | What the character wants — drives their actions and alliances                                       | Power and control over the outcome of the war                                 |
| **Fear**         | What the character dreads — drives their mistakes and vulnerabilities                               | Being a pawn in someone else's game                                           |
| **Speech style** | Concrete voice direction so dialogue sounds like a person, not a bot                                | "Precise intelligence language with subtle manipulation"                      |

The MBTI type is not a horoscope — it's a **consistency framework**. When the LLM generates dialogue, decisions, and reactions over 24 missions, the personality type keeps the character's voice and behavior coherent. An ISTJ commander (Petrov) responds to a crisis differently than an ESTP commando (Volkov): Petrov consults doctrine, Volkov acts immediately. An ENTJ intelligence officer (Sonya) challenges the player's plan head-on; an INFJ would express doubts obliquely. The LLM's system prompt maps each type to concrete behavioral patterns:

- **Under stress:** How the character cracks (ISTJ → becomes rigidly procedural; ESTP → reckless improvisation; ENTJ → autocratic overreach; INTJ → cold withdrawal)
- **In conflict:** How they argue (ST types cite facts; NF types appeal to values; TJ types issue ultimatums; FP types walk away)
- **Loyalty shifts:** What makes them stay or leave (SJ types value duty and chain of command; NP types value autonomy and moral alignment; NT types follow competence; SF types follow personal bonds)
- **Dialogue voice:** How they talk (specific sentence structures, vocabulary patterns, verbal tics, and what they never say)

**The flaw/desire/fear triangle** is the engine of character drama. Every meaningful character moment comes from the collision between what a character wants, what they're afraid of, and the weakness that undermines them. Sonya *wants* control, *fears* being a pawn, and her *flaw* (ends justify means) is exactly what makes her vulnerable to becoming the thing she fears. The LLM uses this triangle to generate character arcs that feel authored, not random.

**Ensemble dynamics:**

The LLM doesn't build characters in isolation — it builds a cast with deliberate personality contrasts. The system prompt instructs:

- **No duplicate MBTI types** in the core cast (3–5 characters). Personality diversity creates natural interpersonal tension.
- **Complementary and opposing pairs.** Petrov (ISTJ, duty-bound) and Sonya (ENTJ, ambitious) disagree on *why* they're fighting. Volkov (ESTP, lives-for-combat) and a hypothetical diplomat character (INFJ, seeks-peace) disagree on *whether* they should be. These pairings generate conflict without scripting.
- **Role alignment — or deliberate misalignment.** A character whose MBTI fits their role (ISTJ commander) is reliable. A character whose personality clashes with their role (ENFP intelligence officer — creative but unfocused) creates tension that pays off during crises.

**Inter-character dynamics (MBTI interaction simulation):**

Characters don't exist in isolation — they interact with each other, and those interactions are where the best drama lives. The LLM uses MBTI compatibility and tension patterns to simulate how characters relate, argue, collaborate, and clash *with each other* — not just with the player.

The system prompt maps personality pairings to interaction patterns:

| Pairing dynamic                              | Example                                   | Interaction pattern                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NT + NT** (strategist meets strategist)    | Sonya (ENTJ) vs. Morrison (INTJ)          | Intellectual respect masking mutual threat. Each anticipates the other's moves. Conversations are chess games. If forced to cooperate, they're devastatingly effective — but neither trusts the other to stay loyal.                        |
| **ST + NF** (realist meets idealist)         | Petrov (ISTJ) + diplomat (INFJ)           | Petrov dismisses idealism as naïve; the diplomat sees Petrov as a blunt instrument. Under pressure, the diplomat's moral clarity gives Petrov purpose he didn't know he lacked.                                                             |
| **SP + SJ** (improviser meets rule-follower) | Volkov (ESTP) + Petrov (ISTJ)             | Volkov breaks protocol; Petrov enforces it. They argue constantly — but Volkov's improvisation saves the squad when doctrine fails, and Petrov's discipline saves them when improvisation gets reckless. Grudging mutual respect over time. |
| **TJ + FP** (commander meets rebel)          | Sonya (ENTJ) + a resistance leader (ISFP) | Sonya issues orders; the ISFP resists on principle. Sonya sees inefficiency; the ISFP sees tyranny. The conflict escalates until one of them is proven right — or both are proven wrong.                                                    |

The LLM generates inter-character dialogue — not just player-facing briefings — by simulating how each character would respond to the other's personality. When Petrov delivers a mission debrief and Volkov interrupts with a joke, the LLM knows Petrov's ISTJ response is clipped disapproval ("This isn't the time, Sergeant"), not laughter. When Sonya proposes a morally questionable plan, the LLM knows which characters push back (NF types, SF types) and which support it (NT types, pragmatic ST types).

Over a 24-mission campaign, these simulated interactions create emergent relationships that the LLM tracks in narrative threads. A Petrov-Volkov friction arc might evolve from mutual irritation (missions 1–5) to grudging respect (missions 6–12) to genuine trust (missions 13–20) to devastating loss if one of them dies. None of this is scripted — it emerges from consistent MBTI-driven behavioral simulation applied to the campaign's actual events.

**Story Style Presets:**

The `story_style` parameter controls how the LLM constructs both characters and narrative. The default — **C&C Classic** — is designed to feel like an actual C&C campaign:

| Style                     | Character Voice                                                                                                                                                   | Narrative Feel                                                                                                                                         | Inspired By                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **C&C Classic** (default) | Over-the-top military personalities. Commanders are larger-than-life. Villains monologue. Heroes quip under fire. Every character is memorable on first briefing. | Bombastic Cold War drama with genuine tension underneath. Betrayals. Superweapons. Last stands. The war is absurd and deadly serious at the same time. | RA1/RA2 campaigns, Tanya's one-liners, Stalin's theatrics, Yuri's menace, Carville's charm |
| **Realistic Military**    | Understated professionalism. Characters speak in military shorthand. Emotions are implied, not stated.                                                            | Band of Brothers tone. The horror of war comes from what's *not* said. Missions feel like operations, not adventures.                                  | Generation Kill, Black Hawk Down, early Tom Clancy                                         |
| **Political Thriller**    | Everyone has an agenda. Dialogue is subtext-heavy. Trust is currency.                                                                                             | Slow-burn intrigue with sudden violence. The real enemy is often on your own side.                                                                     | The Americans, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Metal Gear Solid                                 |
| **Pulp Sci-Fi**           | Characters are archetypes turned to 11. Scientists are mad. Soldiers are grizzled. Villains are theatrical.                                                       | Experimental tech, dimension portals, time travel, alien artifacts. Camp embraced, not apologized for.                                                 | RA2 Yuri's Revenge, C&C Renegade, Starship Troopers                                        |
| **Character Drama**       | Deeply human characters with complex motivations. Relationships shift over the campaign.                                                                          | The war is the backdrop; the story is about the people. Victory feels bittersweet. Loss feels personal.                                                | The Wire, Battlestar Galatica, This War of Mine                                            |

The default (C&C Classic) exists because generative campaigns should feel like C&C out of the box — not generic military fiction. Kane, Tanya, Yuri, and Carville are memorable because they're *specific*: exaggerated personalities with distinctive voices, clear motivations, and dramatic reveals. The LLM's system prompt for C&C Classic includes explicit guidance: "Characters should be instantly recognizable from their first line of dialogue. A commander who speaks in forgettable military platitudes is a failed character. Every briefing should have a line worth quoting."

Players who want a different narrative texture pick a different style — or write a freeform description. The `custom_instructions` field in Advanced parameters stacks with the style preset, so a player can select "C&C Classic" and add "but make the villain sympathetic" for a hybrid tone.

**C&C Classic — Narrative DNA (LLM System Prompt Guidelines):**

The "C&C Classic" preset isn't just a label — it's a set of concrete generation rules derived from Principle #20 (Narrative Identity) in [13-PHILOSOPHY.md](13-PHILOSOPHY.md). When the LLM generates content in this style, its system prompt includes the following directives. These also serve as authoring guidelines for hand-crafted IC campaigns.

*Tone rules:*

1. **Play everything straight.** Never acknowledge absurdity. A psychic weapon is presented with the same military gravitas as a tank column. A trained attack dolphin gets a unit briefing, not a joke. The audience finds the humor because the world takes itself seriously — the moment the writing winks, the spell breaks.
2. **Escalate constantly.** Every act raises the stakes. If mission 1 is "secure a bridge," mission 8 should involve a superweapon, and mission 20 should threaten civilization. C&C campaigns climb from tactical skirmish to existential crisis. Never de-escalate the macro arc, even if individual missions provide breathers.
3. **Make it quotable.** Before finalizing any briefing, villain monologue, or unit voice line, apply the quotability test: would a player repeat this line to a friend? Would it work as a forum signature? If a line communicates information but isn't memorable, rewrite it until it is.

*Character rules:*

4. **First line establishes personality.** A character's introduction must immediately communicate who they are. Generic: "Commander, I'll be your intelligence officer." C&C Classic: "Commander, I've read your file. Impressive — if any of it is true." The personality is the introduction.
5. **Villains believe they're right.** C&C villains — Kane, Yuri, Stalin — are compelling because they have genuine convictions. Kane isn't evil for evil's sake; he has a vision. Generate villains with philosophy, not just malice. The best villain dialogue makes the player pause and think "...he has a point."
6. **Heroes have attitude, not perfection.** Tanya isn't a generic soldier — she's cocky, impatient, and treats war like a playground. Carville isn't a generic general — he's folksy, irreverent, and drops Southern metaphors. Generate heroes with specific personality quirks that make them fun, not admirable.
7. **Betrayal is always personal.** C&C campaigns are built on betrayals — and the best ones hurt because you liked the character. If the campaign skeleton includes a betrayal arc, invest missions in making that character genuinely likeable first. A betrayal by a cipher is plot. A betrayal by someone you trusted is drama.

*World-building rules:*

8. **Cold War as mythology, not history.** Real Cold War events are raw material, not constraints. Einstein erasing Hitler, chronosphere technology, psychic amplifiers, orbital ion cannons — these are mythological amplifications of real anxieties. Generate world details that feel like Cold War fever dreams, not Wikipedia entries.
9. **Technology is dramatic, not realistic.** Every weapon and structure should evoke a feeling. "GAP generator" isn't just radar jamming — it's shrouding your base in mystery. "Iron Curtain device" isn't just invulnerability — it's invoking the most famous metaphor of the Cold War era. Name technologies for dramatic impact, not technical accuracy.
10. **Factions are worldviews.** Allied briefings should feel like Western military confidence: professional, optimistic, technologically superior, with an undercurrent of "we're the good guys, right?" Soviet briefings should feel like revolutionary conviction: the individual serves the collective, sacrifice is glory, industrial might is beautiful. Generate faction-specific vocabulary, sentence structure, and emotional register — not just different unit names.

*Structural rules:*

11. **Every mission has a "moment."** A moment is a scripted event that creates an emotional peak — a character's dramatic entrance, a surprise betrayal, a superweapon firing, an unexpected ally, a desperate last stand. Missions without moments are forgettable. Generate at least one moment per mission, placed at a dramatically appropriate time (not always the climax — a mid-mission gut punch is often stronger).
12. **Briefings sell the mission.** The briefing exists to make the player *want* to play the next mission. It should end with a question (explicit or implied) that the mission answers. "Can we take the beachhead before Morrison moves his armor south?" The player clicks "Deploy" because they want to find out.
13. **Debriefs acknowledge what happened.** Post-mission debriefs should reference specific battle report outcomes: casualties, key moments, named units that survived or died. A debrief that says "Well done, Commander" regardless of outcome is a failed debrief. React to the player's actual experience.

> **Cross-reference:** These rules derive from Principle #20 (Narrative Identity — Earnest Commitment, Never Ironic Distance) in [13-PHILOSOPHY.md](13-PHILOSOPHY.md), which establishes the seven C&C narrative pillars. The rules above are the specific, actionable LLM directives and human authoring guidelines that implement those pillars for content generation. Other story style presets (Realistic Military, Political Thriller, etc.) have their own rule sets — but C&C Classic is the default because it captures the franchise's actual identity.

**Step 3 — Post-Mission Inspection & Progressive Generation:**

After each mission, the system collects a detailed **battle report** — not just "win/lose" but a structured account of what happened during gameplay. This report is the LLM's primary input for generating the next mission. The LLM inspects what actually occurred and reacts to it against the backstory and campaign arc.

**What the battle report captures:**

- **Outcome:** which named outcome the player achieved (victory variant, defeat variant)
- **Casualties:** units lost by type, how they died (combat, friendly fire, sacrificed), named characters killed or wounded
- **Surviving forces:** exact roster state — what the player has left to carry forward
- **Buildings:** structures built, destroyed, captured (especially enemy structures)
- **Economy:** resources gathered, spent, remaining; whether the player was resource-starved or flush
- **Timeline:** mission duration, how quickly objectives were completed, idle periods
- **Territory:** areas controlled at mission end, ground gained or lost
- **Key moments:** scripted triggers that fired (or didn't), secondary objectives attempted, hidden objectives discovered
- **Enemy state:** what enemy forces survived, whether the enemy retreated or was annihilated, enemy structures remaining
- **Player behavior patterns:** aggressive vs. defensive play, tech rush vs. mass production, micromanagement intensity (from D042 event logs)

The LLM receives this battle report alongside the campaign context and generates the next mission **as a direct reaction to what happened.** This is not "fill in the next slot in a pre-planned arc" — it's "inspect the battlefield aftermath and decide what happens next in the story."

**How inspection drives generation:**

1. **Narrative consequences.** The LLM sees the player barely survived mission 5 with 3 tanks and no base — the next mission isn't a large-scale assault. It's a desperate retreat, a scavenging mission, or a resistance operation behind enemy lines. The campaign *genre* shifts based on the player's actual situation.
2. **Escalation and de-escalation.** If the player steamrolled mission 3, the LLM escalates: the enemy regroups, brings reinforcements, changes tactics. If the player struggled, the LLM provides a breather mission — resupply, ally arrival, intelligence gathering.
3. **Story continuity.** The LLM references specific events: "Commander, the bridge at Danzig we lost in the last operation — the enemy is using it to move armor south. We need it back." Because the player actually lost that bridge.
4. **Character reactions.** Named characters react to what happened. Volkov's briefing changes if the player sacrificed civilians in the last mission. Sonya questions the commander's judgment after heavy losses. Morrison taunts the player after a defensive victory: "You held the line. Impressive. It won't save you."
5. **Campaign arc awareness.** The LLM knows where it is in the story — mission 8 of 24, end of Act 1 — and paces accordingly. Early missions establish, middle missions complicate, late missions resolve. But the *specific* complications come from the battle reports, not from a pre-written script.
6. **Mission number context.** The LLM knows which mission number it's generating relative to the total (or relative to victory conditions in open-ended mode). Mission 3/24 gets an establishing tone. Mission 20/24 gets climactic urgency. The story progression scales accordingly — the LLM won't generate a "final confrontation" at mission 6 unless the campaign is 8 missions long.

**Step 4 — Campaign Context (the LLM's memory):**

The LLM doesn't have inherent memory between generation calls. The system maintains a **campaign context** document — a structured summary of everything that has happened — and includes it in every generation prompt. This is the bridge between "generate mission N" and "generate mission N+1 that makes sense."

```rust
/// Accumulated campaign context — passed to the LLM with each generation request.
/// Grows over the campaign but is summarized/compressed to fit context windows.
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct GenerativeCampaignContext {
    /// The original campaign skeleton (backstory, arc, characters).
    pub skeleton: CampaignSkeleton,
    
    /// Campaign parameters chosen by the player at setup.
    pub parameters: CampaignParameters,
    
    /// Per-mission summary of what happened (compressed narrative, not raw state).
    pub mission_history: Vec<MissionSummary>,
    
    /// Current state of each named character — tracks everything the LLM needs
    /// to write them consistently and evolve their arc.

    /// Active story flags and campaign variables (D021 persistent state).
    pub flags: HashMap<String, Value>,
    
    /// Current unit roster summary (unit counts by type, veterancy distribution,

    pub kills: u32,                      // if a field unit — combat track record
    pub notable_events: Vec<String>,     // "betrayed the player in mission 12", "saved Volkov in mission 7"
    pub current_narrative_role: String,  // "ally", "antagonist", "rival", "prisoner", "rogue"
}

pub enum CharacterStatus {
    Alive,
    Dead { mission: u32, cause: String },     // permanently gone
    MIA { since_mission: u32 },                // may return
    Captured { by_faction: String },           // rescue or prisoner exchange possible
    Defected { to_faction: String, mission: u32 }, // switched sides
    Rogue { since_mission: u32 },              // operating independently
}
```

**Context window management:** The context grows with each mission. For long campaigns (24+ missions), the system compresses older mission summaries into shorter recaps (the LLM itself does this compression: "Summarize missions 1–8 in 200 words, retaining key plot points and character developments"). This keeps the prompt within typical context window limits (~8K–32K tokens for the campaign context, leaving room for the generation instructions and output).

#### Generated Output = Standard D021 Campaigns

Everything the LLM generates is standard IC format:

| Carryover config     | D021 carryover modes                                                 | Identical             |

This is the key architectural decision: **there is no "generative campaign runtime."** The LLM is a content creation tool. Once a mission is generated, it's a normal mission. Once the full campaign is complete (all 24 missions played), it's a normal D021 campaign — playable by anyone, with or without an LLM.

#### Cinematic & Narrative Generation

A generated mission that plays well but *feels* empty — no mid-mission dialogue, no music shifts, no character moments, no dramatic reveals — is a mission that fails the C&C fantasy. The original Red Alert didn't just have good missions; it had missions where Stavros called you on the radar mid-battle, where the music shifted from ambient to Hell March when the tanks rolled in, where Tanya dropped a one-liner before breaching the base. That's the standard.

The LLM generates the **full cinematic layer** for each mission — not just objectives and unit placement, but the narrative moments that make a mission feel authored:

**Mid-mission radar comm events:**

The classic C&C moment: your radar screen flickers, a character's face appears, they deliver intel or a dramatic line. The LLM generates these as D038 Radar Comm modules, triggered by game events:

```yaml
# LLM-generated radar comm event
radar_comms:
  - id: bridge_warning
    trigger:
      type: unit_enters_region
      region: bridge_approach
      faction: player
    speaker: "General Stavros"
    portrait: stavros_concerned
    text: "Commander, our scouts report heavy armor at the bridge. Going in head-on would be suicide. There's a ford upstream — shallow enough for infantry."
    audio: null                        # TTS if available, silent otherwise
    display_mode: radar_comm           # replaces radar panel
    duration: 6.0                      # seconds, then radar returns
    
  - id: betrayal_reveal
    trigger:
      type: objective_complete
      objective: capture_command_post
    speaker: "Colonel Vasquez"
    portrait: vasquez_smug
    text: "Surprised to see me, Commander? Your General Stavros sold you out. These men now answer to me."
    display_mode: radar_comm
    effects:
      - set_flag: vasquez_betrayal
      - convert_units:                 # allied garrison turns hostile
          region: command_post_interior
          from_faction: player
          to_faction: enemy
    cinematic: true                    # brief letterbox + game pause for drama
```

The LLM decides *when* these moments should happen based on the mission's narrative arc. A routine mission might have 1-2 comms (intel at start, debrief at end). A story-critical mission might have 5-6, including a mid-battle betrayal, a desperate plea for reinforcements, and a climactic confrontation.

**In-mission branching dialogues (RPG-style choices):**

Not just in intermissions — branching dialogue can happen *during* a mission. An NPC unit is reached, a dialogue triggers, the player makes a choice that affects the mission in real-time:

```yaml
mid_mission_dialogues:
  - id: prisoner_interrogation
    trigger:
      type: unit_enters_region
      unit: tanya
      region: prison_compound
    pause_game: true                   # freezes game during dialogue
    tree:
      - speaker: "Captured Officer"
        portrait: captured_officer
        text: "I'll tell you everything — the mine locations, the patrol routes. Just let me live."
        choices:
          - label: "Talk. Now."
            effects:
              - reveal_shroud: minefield_region
              - set_flag: intel_acquired
            next: officer_cooperates
          - label: "We don't negotiate with the enemy."
            effects:
              - set_flag: officer_executed
              - adjust_character: { name: "Tanya", loyalty: -5 }
            next: tanya_reacts
          - label: "You'll come with us. Command will want to talk to you."
            effects:
              - spawn_unit: { type: prisoner_escort, region: prison_compound }
              - add_objective: { text: "Extract the prisoner to the LZ", type: secondary }
            next: extraction_added
      
      - id: officer_cooperates
        speaker: "Captured Officer"
        text: "The mines are along the ridge — I'll mark them on your map. And Commander... the base commander is planning to retreat at 0400."
        effects:
          - add_objective: { text: "Destroy the base before 0400", type: bonus, timer: 300 }
      
      - id: tanya_reacts
        speaker: "Tanya"
        portrait: tanya_cold
        text: "Your call, Commander. But he might have known something useful."
```

These are **full D038 Dialogue Editor trees** — the same format a human designer would create. The LLM generates them with awareness of the mission's objectives, characters, and narrative context. The choices have *mechanical consequences* — revealing shroud, adding objectives, changing timers, spawning units, adjusting character loyalty.

The LLM can also generate **consequence chains** — a choice in Mission 5's dialogue affects Mission 7's setup (via story flags). "You spared the officer in Mission 5" → in Mission 7, that officer appears as an informant. The LLM tracks these across the campaign context.

**Dynamic music generation:**

The LLM doesn't compose music — it curates it. For each mission, the LLM generates a D038 Music Playlist with mood-tagged tracks selected from the game module's soundtrack and any Workshop music packs the player has installed:

```yaml
music:
  mode: dynamic
  tracks:
    ambient:
      - fogger                         # game module default
      - workshop:cold-war-ost/frozen_fields   # from Workshop music pack
    combat:
      - hell_march
      - grinder
    tension:
      - radio_2
      - workshop:cold-war-ost/countdown
    victory:
      - credits
  
  # Scripted music cues (override dynamic system at specific moments)
  scripted_cues:
    - trigger: { type: timer, seconds: 0 }         # mission start
      track: fogger
      fade_in: 3.0
    - trigger: { type: objective_complete, objective: breach_wall }
      track: hell_march
      fade_in: 0.5                                  # hard cut — dramatic
    - trigger: { type: flag_set, flag: vasquez_betrayal }
      track: workshop:cold-war-ost/countdown
      fade_in: 1.0
```

The LLM picks tracks that match the mission's tone. A desperate defense mission gets tense ambient tracks and hard-hitting combat music. A stealth infiltration gets quiet ambient and reserves the intense tracks for when the alarm triggers. The scripted cues tie specific music moments to narrative beats — the betrayal hits differently when the music shifts at exactly the right moment.

**Cinematic sequences:**

For high-stakes moments, the LLM generates full D038 Cinematic Sequences — multi-step scripted events combining camera movement, dialogue, music, unit spawns, and letterbox:

```yaml
cinematic_sequences:
  - id: reinforcement_arrival
    trigger:
      type: objective_complete
      objective: hold_position_2_min
    skippable: true
    steps:
      - type: letterbox
        enable: true
        transition_time: 0.5
      - type: camera_pan
        from: player_base
        to: beach_landing
        duration: 3.0
        easing: ease_in_out
      - type: play_music
        track: hell_march
        fade_in: 0.5
      - type: spawn_units
        units: [medium_tank, medium_tank, medium_tank, apc, apc]
        position: beach_landing
        faction: player
        arrival: landing_craft          # visual: landing craft delivers them
      - type: dialogue
        speaker: "Admiral Kowalski"
        portrait: kowalski_grinning
        text: "The cavalry has arrived, Commander. Where do you want us?"
        duration: 4.0
      - type: camera_pan
        to: player_base
        duration: 2.0
      - type: letterbox
        enable: false
        transition_time: 0.5
```

The LLM generates these for **key narrative moments** — not every trigger. Typical placement:

| Moment                     | Frequency           | Example                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mission intro**          | Every mission       | Camera pan across the battlefield, briefing dialogue overlay   |
| **Reinforcement arrival**  | 30-50% of missions  | Camera shows troops landing/parachuting in, commander dialogue |
| **Mid-mission plot twist** | 20-40% of missions  | Betrayal reveal, surprise enemy, intel discovery               |
| **Objective climax**       | Key objectives only | Bridge explosion, base breach, hostage rescue                  |
| **Mission conclusion**     | Every mission       | Victory/defeat sequence, debrief comm                          |

**Intermission dialogue and narrative scenes:**

Between missions, the LLM generates intermission screens that go beyond simple briefings:

- **Branching dialogue with consequences** — "General, do we reinforce the eastern front or push west?" The choice affects the next mission's setup, available forces, or strategic position.
- **Character moments** — two named characters argue about strategy. The player's choice affects their loyalty and relationship. A character whose advice is ignored too many times might defect (Campaign Event Patterns).
- **Intel briefings** — the player reviews intelligence gathered from the previous mission. What they focus on (or ignore) shapes the next mission's surprises.
- **Moral dilemmas** — execute the prisoner or extract intel? Bomb the civilian bridge or let the enemy escape? These set story flags that ripple forward through the campaign.

The LLM generates these as D038 Intermission Screens using the Dialogue template with Choice panels. Every choice links to a story flag; every flag feeds back into the LLM's campaign context for future mission generation.

**EVA and ambient audio:**

The LLM generates custom EVA notification scripts — mission-specific voice cues beyond the default "Unit lost" / "Construction complete":

```yaml
custom_eva:
  - event: unit_enters_region
    region: minefield_zone

The LLM also generates ambient sound zone definitions for narrative atmosphere — a mission in a forest gets wind and bird sounds; a mission in a bombed-out city gets distant gunfire and sirens.

**What this means in practice:**

A generated mission doesn't just drop units on a map with objectives. A generated mission:

1. Opens with a **cinematic pan** across the battlefield while the commander briefs you
2. Plays **ambient music** that matches the terrain and mood
3. Calls you on the **radar** when something important happens — a new threat, a character moment, a plot development
4. Presents **RPG-style dialogue choices** when you reach key locations or NPCs
5. **Shifts the music** from ambient to combat when the fighting starts
6. Triggers a **mid-mission cinematic** when the plot twists — a betrayal, a reinforcement arrival, a bridge explosion
7. Announces custom **EVA warnings** for mission-specific hazards
8. Ends with a **conclusion sequence** — victory celebration or desperate evacuation
9. Transitions to an **intermission** with character dialogue, choices, and consequences

All of it is standard D038 format. All of it is editable after generation. All of it works exactly like hand-crafted content. The LLM just writes it faster.

#### Generative Media Pipeline (Forward-Looking)

The sections above describe the LLM generating *text*: YAML definitions, Lua triggers, briefing scripts, dialogue trees. But the full C&C experience isn't text — it's voice-acted briefings, dynamic music, sound effects, and cutscenes. Currently, generative campaigns use existing media assets: game module sound libraries, Workshop music packs, the player's installed voice collections. A mission briefing is *text* that the player reads; a radar comm event is a text bubble without voice audio.

AI-generated media — voice synthesis, music generation, sound effect creation, and eventually video/cutscene generation — is advancing rapidly. By the time IC reaches Phase 7, production-quality AI voice synthesis will be mature (it largely is already in 2025–2026), AI music generation is approaching usable quality, and AI video is on a clear trajectory. The generative media pipeline prepares for this without creating obstacles for a media-free fallback.

**Core design principle: every generative media feature is a progressive enhancement.** A generative campaign plays identically with or without media generation. Text briefings work. Music from the existing library works. Silent radar comms with text work. When AI media providers are available, they *enhance* the experience — voiced briefings, custom music, generated sound effects — but nothing *depends* on them.

**Three tiers of generative media (from most ambitious to most conservative):**

**Tier 1 — Live generation during generative campaigns:**

The most ambitious mode. The player is playing a generative campaign. Between missions, during the loading/intermission screen, the system generates media for the next mission in real-time. The player reads the text briefing while voice synthesis runs in the background; when ready, the briefing replays with voice. If voice generation isn't finished in time, the text-only version is already playing — no delay.

| Media Type       | Generation Window                                       | Fallback (if not ready or unavailable)          | Provider Class                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Voice lines**  | Loading screen / intermission (~15–30s)                 | Text-only briefing, text bubble radar comms     | Voice synthesis (ElevenLabs, local TTS, XTTS, Bark, Piper)   |
| **Music tracks** | Pre-generated during campaign setup or between missions | Existing game module soundtrack, Workshop packs | Music generation (Suno, Udio, MusicGen, local models)        |
| **Sound FX**     | Pre-generated during mission generation                 | Game module default sound library               | Sound generation (AudioGen, Stable Audio, local models)      |
| **Cutscenes**    | Pre-generated between missions (longer)                 | Text+portrait briefing, radar comm text overlay | Video generation (future — Sora class, Runway, local models) |

**Architecture:**

```rust
/// Trait for media generation providers. Same BYOLLM pattern as LlmProvider.
/// Each media type has its own trait — providers are specialized.
pub trait VoiceProvider: Send + Sync {
    /// Generate speech audio from text + voice profile.
    /// Returns audio data in a standard format (WAV/OGG).
    fn synthesize(
        &self,
        text: &str,
        voice_profile: &VoiceProfile,
        options: &VoiceSynthesisOptions,
    ) -> Result<AudioData>;
}

pub trait MusicProvider: Send + Sync {
    /// Generate a music track from mood/style description.
    /// Returns audio data in a standard format.
    fn generate_track(
        &self,
        description: &MusicPrompt,
        duration_secs: f32,
        options: &MusicGenerationOptions,
    ) -> Result<AudioData>;
}

pub trait SoundFxProvider: Send + Sync {
    /// Generate a sound effect from description.
    fn generate_sfx(
        &self,
        description: &str,
        duration_secs: f32,
    ) -> Result<AudioData>;
}

pub trait VideoProvider: Send + Sync {
    /// Generate a video clip from description + character portraits + context.
    fn generate_video(
        &self,
        description: &VideoPrompt,
        options: &VideoGenerationOptions,
    ) -> Result<VideoData>;
}

/// Voice profile for consistent character voices across a campaign.
/// Stored in campaign context alongside CharacterState.
pub struct VoiceProfile {
    /// Character name — links to campaign skeleton character.
    pub character_name: String,
    /// Voice description for the provider (text prompt).
    /// e.g., "Deep male voice, Russian accent, military authority, clipped speech."
    pub voice_description: String,
    /// Provider-specific voice ID (if using a cloned/preset voice).
    pub voice_id: Option<String>,
    /// Reference audio sample (if provider supports voice cloning from sample).
    pub reference_audio: Option<AudioData>,
}
```

**Voice consistency model:** The most critical challenge for campaign voice generation is consistency — the same character must sound the same across 24 missions. The `VoiceProfile` is created during campaign skeleton generation (Step 2) and persisted in `GenerativeCampaignContext`. The LLM generates the voice description from the character's personality profile (Principle #20 — a ISTJ commander sounds different from an ESTP commando). If the provider supports voice cloning from a sample, the system generates one calibration line during setup and uses that sample as the reference for all subsequent voice generation. If not, the text description must be consistent enough that the provider produces recognizably similar output.

**Music mood integration:** The generation pipeline already produces music playlists with mood tags (combat, tension, ambient, victory). When a `MusicProvider` is configured, the system can generate mission-specific tracks from these mood tags instead of selecting from existing libraries. The LLM adds mission-specific context to the music prompt: "Tense ambient track for a night infiltration mission in an Arctic setting, building to war drums when combat triggers fire." Generated tracks are cached in the campaign save — once created, they're standard audio files.

**Tier 2 — Pre-generated campaign (full media creation upfront):**

The more conservative mode. The player configures a generative campaign, clicks "Generate Campaign," and the system creates the entire campaign — all missions, all briefings, all media — before the first mission starts. This takes longer (minutes to hours depending on provider speed and campaign length) but produces a complete, polished campaign package.

This mode is also the **content creator workflow**: a modder or community member generates a campaign, reviews/edits it in the SDK (D038), replaces any weak AI-generated media with hand-crafted alternatives, and publishes the polished result to the Workshop. The AI-generated media is a *starting point*, not a final product.

| Advantage                      | Trade-off                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complete before play begins    | Long generation time (depends on provider)                          |
| All media reviewable in SDK    | Higher API cost (all media generated at once)                       |
| Publishable to Workshop as-is  | Less reactive to player choices (media pre-committed, not adaptive) |
| Can replace weak media by hand | Requires all providers configured upfront                           |

**Generation pipeline (extends Step 2 — Campaign Skeleton):**

After the campaign skeleton is generated, the media pipeline runs:

1. **Voice profiles** — create `VoiceProfile` for each named character. If voice cloning is supported, generate calibration samples.
2. **All mission briefings** — generate voice audio for every briefing text, every radar comm event, every intermission dialogue line.
3. **Mission music** — generate mood-appropriate tracks for each mission (or select from existing library + generate only gap-filling tracks).
4. **Mission-specific sound FX** — generate any custom sound effects referenced in mission scripts (ambient weather, unique weapon sounds, environmental audio).
5. **Cutscenes** (future) — generate video sequences for mission intros, mid-mission cinematics, campaign intro/outro.

Each step is independently skippable — a player might configure voice synthesis but skip music generation, using the game's built-in soundtrack. The campaign save tracks which media was generated vs. sourced from existing libraries.

**Tier 3 — SDK Asset Studio integration:**

This tier already exists architecturally (D040 § Layer 3 — Agentic Asset Generation) but currently covers only visual assets (sprites, palettes, terrain, chrome). The generative media pipeline extends the Asset Studio to cover audio and video:

| Capability              | Asset Studio Tool                                                                                 | Provider Trait    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Voice acting**        | Record text → generate voice → preview on timeline → adjust pitch/speed → export .ogg/.wav        | `VoiceProvider`   |
| **EVA line generation** | Select EVA event type → generate authoritative voice → preview in-game → export to sound library  | `VoiceProvider`   |
| **Music composition**   | Describe mood/style → generate track → preview against gameplay footage → trim/fade → export .ogg | `MusicProvider`   |
| **Sound FX design**     | Describe effect → generate → preview → layer with existing FX → export .wav                       | `SoundFxProvider` |
| **Cutscene creation**   | Write script → generate video → preview in briefing player → edit → export .mp4/.webm             | `VideoProvider`   |
| **Voice pack creation** | Define character → generate all voice lines → organize → preview → publish as Workshop voice pack | `VoiceProvider`   |

This is the modder-facing tooling. A modder creating a total conversion can generate an entire voice pack for their custom EVA, unit voice lines for new unit types, ambient music that matches their mod's theme, and briefing videos — all within the SDK, using the same BYOLLM infrastructure.

**Crate boundaries:**

- **`ic-llm`** — implements all provider traits (`VoiceProvider`, `MusicProvider`, `SoundFxProvider`, `VideoProvider`). Routes to configured providers via D047 task routing. Handles API communication, format conversion, caching.
- **`ic-editor`** (SDK) — defines the provider traits (same pattern as `AssetGenerator`). Provides UI for media preview, editing, and export. Tier 3 tools live here.
- **`ic-game`** — wires providers at startup. In generative campaign mode, triggers Tier 1 generation during loading/intermission. Plays generated media through standard `ic-audio` and video playback systems.
- **`ic-audio`** — plays generated audio identically to pre-existing audio. No awareness of generation source.

**What the AI does NOT replace:**

- **Professional voice acting.** AI voice synthesis is serviceable for procedural content but cannot match a skilled human performance. Hand-crafted campaigns (D021) will always benefit from real voice actors. The AI-generated voice is a first draft, not a final product.
- **Composed music.** Frank Klepacki's Hell March was not generated by an algorithm. AI music fills gaps and provides variety; it doesn't replace composed soundtracks. The game module ships with a human-composed soundtrack; AI supplements it.
- **Quality judgment.** The modder/player decides if generated media meets their standards. The SDK shows it in context. The Workshop provides a distribution channel for polished results.

**D047 integration — task routing for media providers:**

The LLM Configuration Manager (D047) extends its task routing to include media generation tasks:

| Task                      | Provider Type     | Typical Routing                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Mission Generation        | `LlmProvider`     | Cloud API (quality)                                  |
| Campaign Briefings        | `LlmProvider`     | Cloud API (quality)                                  |
| Voice Synthesis           | `VoiceProvider`   | ElevenLabs / Local TTS (quality vs. speed trade-off) |
| Music Generation          | `MusicProvider`   | Suno API / Local MusicGen                            |
| Sound FX Generation       | `SoundFxProvider` | AudioGen / Stable Audio                              |
| Video/Cutscene (future)   | `VideoProvider`   | Cloud API (when mature)                              |
| Asset Generation (visual) | `AssetGenerator`  | DALL-E / Stable Diffusion / Local                    |
| AI Orchestrator           | `LlmProvider`     | Local Ollama (fast)                                  |
| Post-Match Coaching       | `LlmProvider`     | Local model (fast)                                   |

Each media provider type is independently configurable. A player might have voice synthesis (local Piper TTS — free, fast, lower quality) but no music generation. The system adapts: generated missions get voiced briefings but use the existing soundtrack.

**Phase:**

- **Phase 7:** Voice synthesis integration (`VoiceProvider` trait, ElevenLabs/Piper/XTTS providers, voice profile system, Tier 1 live generation, Tier 2 pre-generation, Tier 3 SDK voice tools). Voice is the highest-impact media type and the most mature AI capability.
- **Phase 7:** Music generation integration (`MusicProvider` trait, Suno/MusicGen providers, mood-to-prompt translation). Lower priority than voice — existing soundtrack provides good coverage.
- **Phase 7+:** Sound FX generation (`SoundFxProvider`). Useful but niche — game module sound libraries cover most needs.
- **Future:** Video/cutscene generation (`VideoProvider`). Depends on AI video technology maturity. The trait is defined now so the architecture is ready; implementation waits until quality meets the bar. The Asset Studio video pipeline (D040 — .mp4/.webm/.vqa conversion) provides the playback infrastructure.

> **Architectural note:** The design deliberately separates provider traits by media type rather than using a single unified `MediaProvider`. Voice, music, sound, and video providers have fundamentally different inputs, outputs, quality curves, and maturity timelines. A player may have excellent voice synthesis available but no music generation at all. Per-type traits and per-type D047 task routing enable this mix-and-match reality. The progressive enhancement principle ensures every combination works — from "no media providers" (text-only, existing assets) to "all providers configured" (fully generated multimedia campaigns).

#### Saving, Replaying, and Sharing

**Campaign library:**

Every generative campaign is saved to the player's local campaign list:

```

```

- **Auto-naming:** The LLM names each campaign at skeleton generation. The player can rename.
- **Progress tracking:** Shows mission count (played / total), completion status, play time.
- **Rating:** Player can rate their own campaign (personal quality bookmark).
- **Resume:** In-progress campaigns resume from the last completed mission. The next mission generates on resume if not already cached.

**Replayability:**

A completed generative campaign is a complete D021 campaign — all 24 missions exist as YAML + Lua + maps. The player (or anyone they share it with) can replay it from the start without an LLM. The campaign graph, all branching paths, and all mission content are materialized. A replayer can take different branches than the original player did, experiencing the missions the original player never saw.

**Sharing:**

Campaigns are shareable as standard IC campaign packages:

- **Export:** `ic campaign export "Operation Iron Tide"` → produces a `.icpkg` campaign package (ZIP with `campaign.yaml`, mission files, maps, Lua scripts, assets). Same format as any hand-crafted campaign.
- **Workshop publish:** One-click publish to Workshop (D030). The campaign appears alongside hand-crafted campaigns — there's no second-class status. Tags indicate "LLM-generated" for discoverability, not segregation.
- **Import:** Other players install the campaign like any Workshop content. No LLM needed to play.

**Community refinement:**

Shared campaigns are standard IC content — fully editable. Community members can:

- **Open in the Campaign Editor (D038):** See the full mission graph, edit transitions, adjust difficulty, fix LLM-generated rough spots.
- **Modify missions in the Scenario Editor:** Adjust unit placement, triggers, objectives, terrain. Polish LLM output into hand-crafted quality.
- **Edit campaign parameters:** The campaign package includes the original `CampaignParameters` and `CampaignSkeleton` YAML. A modder can adjust these and re-generate specific missions (if they have an LLM configured), or directly edit the generated output.
- **Edit inner prompts:** The campaign package preserves the generation prompts used for each mission. A modder can modify these prompts — adjusting tone, adding constraints, changing character behavior — and re-generate specific missions to see different results. This is the "prompt as mod parameter" principle: the LLM instructions are part of the campaign's editable content, not hidden internals.
- **Fork and republish:** Take someone's campaign, improve it, publish as a new version. Standard Workshop versioning applies. Credit the original via Workshop dependency metadata.

This creates a **generation → curation → refinement pipeline**: the LLM generates raw material, the community curates the best campaigns (Workshop ratings, downloads), and skilled modders refine them into polished experiences. The LLM is a starting gun, not the finish line.

#### Branching in Generative Campaigns

Branching is central to generative campaigns, not optional. The LLM generates missions with multiple named outcomes (D021), and the player's choice of outcome drives the next generation.

**Within-mission branching:**

Each generated mission has 2–4 named outcomes. These aren't just win/lose — they're narrative forks:

- "Victory — civilians evacuated" vs. "Victory — civilians sacrificed for tactical advantage"
- "Victory — Volkov survived" vs. "Victory — Volkov killed covering the retreat"
- "Defeat — orderly retreat" vs. "Defeat — routed, heavy losses"

The LLM generates different outcome descriptions and assigns different story flag effects to each. The next mission is generated based on which outcome the player achieved.

**Between-mission branching:**

The campaign skeleton includes planned branch points (approximately every 4–6 missions). At these points, the LLM generates 2–3 possible next missions and lets the campaign graph branch. The player's outcome determines which branch they take — but since missions are generated progressively, the LLM only generates the branch the player actually enters (plus one mission lookahead on the most likely alternate path, for pacing).

**Branch convergence:**

Not every branch diverges permanently. The LLM's skeleton includes convergence points — moments where different paths lead to the same narrative beat (e.g., "regardless of which route you took, the final assault on Berlin begins"). This prevents the campaign from sprawling into an unmanageable tree. The skeleton's act structure naturally creates convergence: all Act 1 paths converge at the Act 2 opening, all Act 2 paths converge at the climax.

**Why branching matters even with LLM generation:**

One might argue that since the LLM generates each mission dynamically, branching is unnecessary — just generate whatever comes next. But branching serves a critical purpose: **the generated campaign must be replayable without an LLM.** Once materialized, the campaign graph must contain the branches the player *didn't* take too, so a replayer (or the same player on a second playthrough) can explore alternate paths. The LLM generates branches ahead of time. Progressive generation generates the branches as they become relevant — not all 24 missions on day one, but also not waiting until the player finishes mission 7 to generate mission 8's alternatives.

#### Campaign Event Patterns

The LLM doesn't just generate "attack this base" missions in sequence. It draws from a vocabulary of **dramatic event patterns** — narrative structures inspired by the C&C franchise's most memorable campaign moments and classic military fiction. These patterns are documented in the system prompt so the LLM has a rich palette to paint from.

The LLM chooses when and how to deploy these patterns based on the campaign context, battle reports, character states, and narrative pacing. None are scripted in advance — they emerge from the interplay of the player's actions and the LLM's storytelling.

**Betrayal & defection patterns:**

- **The backstab.** A trusted ally — an intelligence officer, a fellow commander, a political advisor — switches sides mid-campaign. The turn is foreshadowed in briefings (the LLM plants hints over 2–3 missions: contradictory intel, suspicious absences, intercepted communications), then triggered by a story flag or a player decision. Inspired by: Nadia poisoning Stalin (RA1), Yuri's betrayal (RA2).
- **Defection offer.** An enemy commander, impressed by the player's performance or disillusioned with their own side, secretly offers to defect. The player must decide: accept (gaining intelligence + units but risking a double agent) or refuse. The LLM uses the `relationship_to_player` score from battle reports — if the player spared enemy forces in previous missions, defection becomes plausible.
- **Loyalty erosion.** A character's `loyalty` score drops based on player actions: sacrificing troops carelessly, ignoring a character's advice repeatedly, making morally questionable choices. When loyalty drops below a threshold, the LLM generates a confrontation mission — the character either leaves, turns hostile, or issues an ultimatum.
- **The double agent.** A rescued prisoner, a defector from the enemy, a "helpful" neutral — someone the player trusted turns out to be feeding intelligence to the other side. The reveal comes when the player notices the enemy is always prepared for their strategies (the LLM has been describing suspiciously well-prepared enemies for several missions).

**Rogue faction patterns:**

- **Splinter group.** Part of the player's own faction breaks away — a rogue general forms a splinter army, or a political faction seizes a province and declares independence. The player must fight former allies with the same unit types and tactics. Inspired by: Yuri's army splitting from the Soviets (RA2), rogue Soviet generals in RA1.
- **Third-party emergence.** A faction that didn't exist at campaign start appears mid-campaign: a resistance movement, a mercenary army, a scientific cult with experimental weapons. The LLM introduces them as a complication — sometimes an optional ally, sometimes an enemy, sometimes both at different times.
- **Warlord territory.** In open-ended campaigns, regions not controlled by either main faction become warlord territories — autonomous zones with their own mini-armies and demands. The LLM generates negotiation or conquest missions for these zones.

**Plot twist patterns:**

- **Secret weapon reveal.** The enemy unveils a devastating new technology: a superweapon, an experimental unit, a weaponized chronosphere. The LLM builds toward the reveal (intelligence fragments over 2–3 missions), then the player faces it in a desperate defense mission. Follow-up missions involve stealing or destroying it.
- **True enemy reveal.** The faction the player has been fighting isn't the real threat. A larger power has been manipulating both sides. The campaign pivots to a temporary alliance with the former enemy against the true threat. Inspired by: RA2 Yuri's Revenge (Allies and Soviets team up against Yuri).
- **The war was a lie.** The player's own command has been giving false intelligence. The "enemy base" the player destroyed in mission 5 was a civilian research facility. The "war hero" the player is protecting is a war criminal. Moral complexity emerges from the campaign's own history, not from a pre-written script.
- **Time pressure crisis.** A countdown starts: nuclear launch, superweapon charging, allied capital about to fall. The next 2–3 missions are a race against time, each one clearing a prerequisite for the final mission (destroy the radar, capture the codes, reach the launch site). The LLM paces this urgently — short missions, high stakes, no breathers.

**Force dynamics patterns:**

- **Army to resistance.** After a catastrophic loss, the player's conventional army is shattered. The campaign genre shifts: smaller forces, guerrilla objectives (sabotage, assassination, intelligence gathering), no base building. The LLM generates this naturally when the battle report shows heavy losses. Rebuilding over subsequent missions gradually restores conventional operations.
- **Underdog to superpower.** The inverse: the player starts with a small force and grows mission by mission. The LLM scales enemy composition accordingly, and the tone shifts from desperate survival to strategic dominance. Late-campaign missions are large-scale assaults the player couldn't have dreamed of in mission 2.
- **Siege / last stand.** The player must hold a critical position against overwhelming odds. Reinforcement timing is the drama — will they arrive? The LLM generates increasingly desperate defensive waves, with the outcome determining whether the campaign continues as a retreat or a counter-attack.
- **Behind enemy lines.** A commando mission deep in enemy territory with a small, hand-picked squad. No reinforcements, no base, limited resources. Named characters shine here. Inspired by: virtually every Tanya mission in the RA franchise.

**Character-driven patterns:**

- **Rescue the captured.** A named character is captured during a mission (or between missions, as a narrative event). The player faces a choice: launch a risky rescue operation, negotiate a prisoner exchange (giving up tactical advantage), or abandon them (with loyalty consequences for other characters). A rescued character returns with changed traits — traumatized, radicalized, or more loyal than ever.
- **Rival commander.** The LLM develops a specific enemy commander as the player's nemesis. This character appears in briefings, taunts the player after defeats, acts surprised after losses. The rivalry develops over 5–10 missions before the final confrontation. The enemy commander reacts to the player's tactics: if the player favors air power, the rival starts deploying heavy AA and mocking the strategy.
- **Mentor's fall.** An experienced commander who guided the player in early missions is killed, goes MIA, or turns traitor. The player must continue without their guidance — the tone shifts from "following orders" to "making hard calls alone."
- **Character return.** A character thought dead or MIA resurfaces — changed. An MIA character returns with intelligence gained during capture. A "dead" character survived and is now leading a resistance cell. A defected character has second thoughts. The LLM tracks `CharacterStatus::MIA` and `CharacterStatus::Dead` and can reverse them with narrative justification.

**Diplomatic & political patterns:**

- **Temporary alliance.** The player's faction and the enemy faction must cooperate against a common threat (rogue faction, third-party invasion, natural disaster). Missions feature mixed unit control — the player commands some enemy units. Trust is fragile; the alliance may end in betrayal.
- **Ceasefire and cold war.** Fighting pauses for 2–3 missions while the LLM generates espionage, infiltration, and political maneuvering missions. The player builds up forces during the ceasefire, knowing combat will resume. When and how it resumes depends on the player's actions during the ceasefire.
- **Civilian dynamics.** Missions where civilians matter: evacuate a city before a bombing, protect a refugee convoy, decide whether to commandeer civilian infrastructure. The player's treatment of civilians affects the campaign's politics — a player who protects civilians gains partisan support; one who sacrifices them faces insurgencies on their own territory.

These patterns are examples, not an exhaustive list. The LLM's system prompt includes them as inspiration. The LLM can also invent novel patterns that don't fit these categories — the constraint is that every event must produce standard D021 missions and respect the campaign's current state, not that every event must match a template.

#### Open-Ended Campaigns

Fixed-length campaigns (8, 16, 24 missions) suit players who want a structured experience. But the most interesting generative campaigns may be **open-ended** — where the campaign continues until victory conditions are met, and the LLM determines the pacing.

**How open-ended campaigns work:**

Instead of "generate 24 missions," the player defines **victory conditions** — a set of goals that, when achieved, trigger the campaign finale:

```yaml
victory_conditions:
  # Any ONE of these triggers the final mission sequence
  - type: eliminate_character
    target: "General Morrison"
    description: "Hunt down and eliminate the Allied Supreme Commander"
  - type: capture_locations
    targets: ["London", "Paris", "Washington"]
    description: "Capture all three Allied capitals"
  - type: survival
    missions: 30
    description: "Survive 30 missions against escalating odds"

# Optional: defeat conditions that end the campaign in failure
defeat_conditions:
  - type: roster_depleted
    threshold: 0       # lose all named characters
    description: "All commanders killed — the war is lost"
  - type: lose_streak
    count: 3
    description: "Three consecutive mission failures — command is relieved"
```

The LLM sees these conditions and works toward them narratively. It doesn't just generate missions until the player happens to kill Morrison — it builds a story arc where Morrison is an escalating threat, intelligence about his location is gathered over missions, near-misses create tension, and the final confrontation feels earned.

**Dynamic narrative shifts:**

Open-ended campaigns enable dramatic genre shifts that fixed-length campaigns can't. The LLM inspects the battle report and can pivot the entire campaign direction:

- **Army → Resistance.** The player starts with a full division. After a devastating defeat in mission 8, they lose most forces. The LLM generates mission 9 as a guerrilla operation — small squad, no base building, ambush tactics, sabotage objectives. The campaign has organically shifted from conventional warfare to an insurgency. If the player rebuilds over the next few missions, it shifts back.
- **Hunter → Hunted.** The player is pursuing a VIP target. The VIP escapes repeatedly. The LLM decides the VIP has learned the player's tactics and launches a counter-offensive. Now the player is defending against an enemy who knows their weaknesses.
- **Rising power → Civil war.** The player's faction is winning the war. Political factions within their own side start competing for control. The LLM introduces betrayal missions where the player fights former allies.
- **Conventional → Desperate.** Resources dry up. Supply lines are cut. The LLM generates missions with scarce starting resources, forcing the player to capture enemy supplies or scavenge the battlefield.

These shifts emerge naturally from the battle reports. The LLM doesn't follow a script — it reads the game state and decides what makes a good story.

**Escalation mechanics:**

In open-ended campaigns, the enemy isn't static. The LLM uses a concept of **enemy adaptation** — the longer the campaign runs, the more the enemy evolves:

- **VIP escalation.** A fleeing VIP gains experience and resources the longer they survive. Early missions to catch them are straightforward pursuits. By mission 15, the VIP has fortified a stronghold, recruited allies, and developed counter-strategies. The difficulty curve is driven by the narrative, not a slider.
- **Enemy learning.** The LLM tracks what strategies the player uses (from battle reports) and has the enemy adapt. Player loves tank rushes? The enemy starts mining approaches and building anti-armor defenses. Player relies on air power? The enemy invests in AA.
- **Resource escalation.** Both sides grow over the campaign. Early missions are skirmishes. Late missions are full-scale battles. The LLM scales force composition to match the campaign's progression.
- **Alliance shifts.** Neutral factions that appeared in early missions may become allies or enemies based on the player's choices. The political landscape evolves.

**How the LLM decides "it's time for the finale":**

The LLM doesn't just check `if conditions_met { generate_finale(); }`. It builds toward the conclusion:

1. **Sensing readiness.** The LLM evaluates whether the player's current roster, position, and narrative momentum make a finale satisfying. If the player barely survived the last mission, the finale waits — a recovery mission first.
2. **Creating the opportunity.** When conditions are approaching (the player has captured 2/3 capitals, Morrison's location is almost known), the LLM generates missions that create the *opportunity* for the final push — intelligence missions, staging operations, securing supply lines.
3. **The finale sequence.** The final mission (or final 2–3 missions) are generated as a climactic arc, not a single mission. The LLM knows these are the last ones and gives them appropriate weight — cutscene-worthy briefings, all surviving named characters present, callbacks to early campaign events.
4. **Earning the ending.** The campaign length is indeterminate but not infinite. The LLM aims for a satisfying arc — typically 15–40 missions depending on the victory conditions. If the campaign has gone on "too long" without progress toward victory (the player keeps failing to advance), the LLM introduces narrative catalysts: an unexpected ally, a turning point event, or a vulnerability in the enemy's position.

**Open-ended campaign identity:**

What makes open-ended campaigns distinct from fixed-length ones:

| Aspect               | Fixed-length (24 missions)               | Open-ended                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **End condition**    | Mission count reached                    | Victory conditions met                           |
| **Skeleton**         | Full arc planned upfront                 | Backstory + conditions + characters; arc emerges |
| **Pacing**           | LLM knows position in arc (mission 8/24) | LLM estimates narrative momentum                 |
| **Narrative shifts** | Planned at branch points                 | Emerge from battle reports                       |
| **Difficulty**       | Follows configured curve                 | Driven by enemy adaptation + player state        |
| **Replayability**    | Take different branches                  | Entirely different campaign length and arc       |
| **Typical length**   | Exactly as configured                    | 15–40 missions (emergent)                        |

Both modes produce standard D021 campaigns. Both are saveable, shareable, and replayable without an LLM. The difference is in how much creative control the LLM exercises during generation.

#### World Domination Campaign

A third generative campaign mode — distinct from both fixed-length narrative campaigns and open-ended condition-based campaigns. **World Domination** is an LLM-driven narrative campaign where the story plays out across a world map. The LLM is the narrative director — it generates missions, drives the story, and decides what happens next based on the player's real-time battle results. The world map is the visualization: territory expands when you win, contracts when you lose, and shifts when the narrative demands it.

This is the mode where the campaign *is* the map.

**How it works:**

The player starts in a region — say, Greece — and fights toward a goal: conquer Europe, defend the homeland, push west to the Atlantic. The LLM generates each mission based on where the player stands on the map, what happened in previous battles, and where the narrative is heading. The player doesn't pick targets from a strategy menu — the LLM presents the next mission (or a choice between missions) based on the story it's building.

After each RTS battle, the results feed back to the LLM. Won decisively? Territory advances. Lost badly? The enemy pushes into your territory. But it's not purely mechanical — the LLM controls the narrative arc. Maybe you lose three missions in a row, your territory shrinks, things look dire — and then the LLM introduces a turning point: your engineers develop a new weapon, a neutral faction joins your side, a storm destroys the enemy's supply lines. Or maybe there's no rescue — you simply lose. The LLM decides based on accumulated battle results, the story it's been building, and the dramatic pacing.

```yaml

  # the player push to 90% if the narrative supports it.

**Region properties:**

Each region on the world map has strategic properties that affect mission generation:

```yaml
regions:
  berlin:
    display_name: "Berlin"
    terrain_type: urban              # affects generated map terrain
    climate: temperate               # affects weather (D022)
    resource_value: 3                # economic importance (LLM considers for narrative weight)
    fortification: heavy             # affects defender advantage
    population: civilian_heavy       # affects civilian presence in missions
    adjacent: ["warsaw", "prague", "hamburg", "munich"]
    special_features:
      - type: factory_complex        # bonus: faster unit production
      - type: airfield               # bonus: air support in adjacent battles
    strategic_importance: critical    # LLM emphasizes this in narrative

  arctic_outpost:
    display_name: "Arctic Research Station"
    terrain_type: arctic
    climate: arctic
    resource_value: 1
    fortification: light
    population: minimal
    adjacent: ["murmansk", "arctic_sea"]
    special_features:
      - type: research_lab           # bonus: unlocks special units/tech
    strategic_importance: moderate
```

**Progress and regression:**

The world map is not a one-way march to victory. The LLM drives territory changes based on battle outcomes *and* narrative arc:

- **Win a mission** → territory typically advances. The LLM decides how much — a minor victory might push one region forward, a decisive rout might cascade into capturing two or three.
- **Lose a mission** → the enemy pushes in. The LLM decides the severity — a narrow loss might mean holding the line but losing influence, while a collapse means the enemy sweeps through multiple regions.
- **Pyrrhic victory** → you won, but at what cost? The LLM might advance your territory but weaken your forces so severely that the next mission is a desperate defense.

But it's not a mechanical formula. The LLM is a **narrative director**, not a spreadsheet. It mixes battle results with story:

- **Recovery arcs:** You've lost three missions. Your territory has shrunk to a handful of regions. Things look hopeless — and then the LLM introduces a breakthrough. Maybe your engineers develop a new superweapon. Maybe a neutral faction defects to your side. Maybe a brutal winter slows the enemy advance and buys you time. The recovery feels earned because it follows real setbacks.
- **Deus ex machina:** Rarely, the LLM creates a dramatic reversal — an earthquake destroys the enemy's main base, a rogue commander switches sides, an intelligence coup reveals the enemy's plans. These are narratively justified and infrequent enough to feel special.
- **Escalation:** You're winning too easily? The LLM introduces complications — a second front opens, the enemy deploys experimental weapons, an ally betrays you. The world map shifts to reflect the new threat.
- **Inevitable defeat:** Sometimes there's no rescue. If the player keeps losing badly and the narrative can't credibly save them, the campaign ends in defeat. The LLM builds to a dramatic conclusion — a last stand, a desperate evacuation, a bitter retreat — rather than just showing "Game Over."

The key insight: **the player's agency is in the RTS battles.** How well you fight determines the raw material the LLM works with. Win well and consistently, and the narrative carries you forward. Fight poorly, and the LLM builds a story of struggle and potential collapse. But the LLM always has latitude to shape the pacing — it's telling a war story, not just calculating territory percentages.

**Force persistence across the map:**

Units aren't disposable between battles. The world domination mode uses a **per-region force pool**:

- Each region the player controls has a garrison (force pool). The player deploys from these forces when attacking from or defending that region.
- Casualties in battle reduce the garrison. Reinforcements arrive as the narrative progresses (based on controlled factories, resource income, and narrative events).
- Veteran units from previous battles remain — a region with battle-hardened veterans is harder to defeat than one with fresh recruits.
- Named characters (D038 Named Characters) can be assigned to regions. Moving them to a front gives bonuses but risks their death.
- D021's roster persistence and carryover apply within the campaign — the "roster" is the regional garrison.

**Mission generation from campaign state:**

The LLM generates each mission from the **strategic situation** — it's not picking from a random pool, it's reading the state of the world and crafting a battle that makes sense:

| Input                       | How it affects the mission                                                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Region terrain type**     | Map terrain (urban streets, arctic tundra, rural farmland, desert, mountain pass)      |
| **Attacker's force pool**   | Player's starting units (drawn from the garrison)                                      |
| **Defender's force pool**   | Enemy's garrison strength (affects enemy unit count and quality)                       |
| **Fortification level**     | Defender gets pre-built structures, mines, walls                                       |
| **Campaign progression**    | Tech level escalation — later in the campaign unlocks higher-tier units                |
| **Adjacent region bonuses** | Airfield = air support; factory = reinforcements mid-mission; radar = revealed shroud  |
| **Special features**        | Research lab = experimental units; port = naval elements                               |
| **Battle history**          | Regions fought over multiple times get war-torn terrain (destroyed buildings, craters) |
| **Narrative arc**           | Briefing, character dialogue, story events, turning points, named objectives           |
| **Player battle results**   | Previous performance shapes difficulty, tone, and stakes of the next mission           |

Without an LLM, missions are generated from **templates** — the system picks a template matching the terrain type and action type (urban assault, rural defense, naval landing, etc.) and populates it with forces from the strategic state. With an LLM, the missions are crafted: the briefing tells a story, characters react to what you did last mission, the objectives reflect the narrative the LLM is building.

**The world map between missions:**

Between missions, the player sees the world map — the D038 World Map intermission template, elevated into the primary campaign interface. The map shows the story so far: where you've been, what you control, and where the narrative is taking you next.

The map is the campaign. The player sees their progress and regression at a glance — territory expanding and contracting as the war ebbs and flows. The LLM presents the next mission through narrative briefing, not through a strategy game menu. Sometimes the LLM offers a choice ("Reinforce the eastern front or press the western advance?") — but the choices are narrative, not board-game actions.

**Comparison to narrative campaigns:**

| Aspect             | Narrative Campaign (fixed/open-ended)      | World Domination                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**      | Linear/branching mission graph             | LLM-driven narrative across a world map            |
| **Mission order**  | Determined by story arc                    | Determined by LLM based on map state + results     |
| **Progress model** | Mission completion advances the story      | Territory changes visualize campaign progress      |
| **Regression**     | Rarely (defeat branches to different path) | Frequent — battles lost = territory lost           |
| **Recovery**       | Fixed by story branches                    | LLM-driven: new tech, allies, events, or defeat    |
| **Player agency**  | Choose outcomes within missions            | Fight well in RTS battles; LLM shapes consequences |

**World domination without LLM:**

World Domination is **playable without an LLM**, though it loses its defining feature. Without the LLM, the system falls back to template-generated missions — pick a template matching the terrain and action type, populate it with forces from the strategic state. Territory advances/retreats follow mechanical rules (win = advance, lose = retreat) instead of narrative-driven pacing. There are no recovery arcs, no turning points, no deus ex machina — just a deterministic strategic layer. It still works as a campaign, but it's closer to a Risk-style conquest game than the narrative experience the LLM provides. The LLM is what makes World Domination feel like a *war story* rather than a *board game*.

**Strategic AI for non-player factions (no-LLM fallback):**

When the LLM drives the campaign, non-player factions behave according to the narrative — the LLM decides when and where the enemy attacks, retreats, or introduces surprises. Without an LLM, a mechanical **strategic AI** controls non-player faction behavior on the world map:

- Each AI faction has an `ai_personality` (D043 preset): `aggressive` (expands toward player), `defensive` (holds territory, counter-attacks only), `opportunistic` (attacks weakened regions), `strategic` (balances expansion and defense).
- The AI evaluates regions by adjacency, garrison strength, and strategic importance. It prioritizes attacking weak borders and reinforcing threatened ones.
- If the player pushes hard on one front, the AI opens a second front on an undefended border — simple but effective strategic pressure.
- The AI's behavior is deterministic given the campaign state, ensuring consistent replay behavior.

This strategic AI is separate from the tactical RTS AI (D043) — it operates on the world map layer, not within individual missions. The tactical AI still controls enemy units during RTS battles.

#### World Map Assets

World maps are **game-module-provided and moddable assets** — not hardcoded. A world map can represent anything: Cold War Europe, the entire globe, a fictional continent, an alien planet, a galactic star map, a subway network — whatever fits the game or mod. The engine doesn't care what the map *is*, only that it has regions with connections. Each game module ships with default world maps, and modders can create their own for any setting they imagine.

**World map definition:**

```yaml
# World map asset — shipped with the game module or created by modders
world_map:
  id: "europe_1953"
  display_name: "Europe 1953"
  game_module: red_alert              # which game module this map is for
  
  # Visual asset — the actual map image
  # Supports multiple render modes (D048): sprite, vector, or 3D globe
  visual:
    base_image: "maps/world/europe_1953.png"    # background image
    region_overlays: "maps/world/europe_1953_regions.png"  # color-coded regions
    faction_colors: true                         # color regions by controlling faction
    animation: frontline_glow                    # animated frontlines between factions
  
  # Region definitions (see region YAML above)
  regions:
    # ... region definitions with adjacency, terrain, resources, etc.
  
  # Starting configurations (selectable in setup)
  scenarios:
    - id: "cold_war_heats_up"
      description: "Classical East vs. West. Soviets hold Eastern Europe, Allies hold the West."
      faction_assignments:
        soviet: ["moscow", "leningrad", "stalingrad", "kiev", "minsk", "warsaw"]
        allied: ["london", "paris", "rome", "berlin", "madrid"]
        neutral: ["stockholm", "bern", "ankara", "cairo", "istanbul"]
    - id: "last_stand"
      description: "Soviets control most of Europe. Allies hold only Britain and France."
      faction_assignments:
        soviet: ["moscow", "leningrad", "stalingrad", "kiev", "minsk", "warsaw", "berlin", "prague", "vienna", "budapest", "rome"]
        allied: ["london", "paris"]
        neutral: ["stockholm", "bern", "ankara", "cairo", "istanbul"]
```

**Game-module world maps:**

Each game module provides at least one default world map:

| Game module   | Default world map | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Red Alert     | `europe_1953`     | Cold War Europe — Soviets vs. Allies            |
| Tiberian Dawn | `gdi_nod_global`  | Global map — GDI vs. Nod, Tiberium spread zones |
| (Community)   | Anything          | The map is whatever the modder wants it to be   |

Community world map examples (the kind of thing modders could create):

- **Pacific Theater** — island-hopping across the Pacific; naval-heavy campaigns
- **Entire globe** — six continents, dozens of regions, full world war
- **Fictional continent** — Westeros, Middle-earth, or an original fantasy setting
- **Galactic star map** — planets as regions, fleets as garrisons, a sci-fi total conversion
- **Single city** — district-by-district urban warfare; each "region" is a city block or neighborhood
- **Underground network** — cavern systems, bunker complexes, tunnel connections
- **Alternate history** — what if the Roman Empire never fell? What if the Cold War went hot in 1962?
- **Abstract/non-geographic** — a network of space stations, a corporate org chart, whatever the mod needs

The world map is a YAML + image asset, loadable from any source: game module defaults, Workshop (D030), or local mod folders. The Campaign Editor (D038) includes a world map editor for creating and editing regions, adjacencies, and starting scenarios.

**World maps as Workshop resources:**

World maps are a first-class Workshop resource category (`category: world-map`). This makes them discoverable, installable, version-tracked, and composable like any other Workshop content:

```yaml
# Workshop manifest for a world map package
package:
  name: "galactic-conquest-map"
  publisher: "scifi-modding-collective"
  version: "2.1.0"
  license: "CC-BY-SA-4.0"
  description: "A 40-region galactic star map for sci-fi total conversions"
  category: world-map
  game_module: any                     # or a specific module
  engine_version: "^0.3.0"
  
  tags: ["sci-fi", "galactic", "space", "large"]
  ai_usage: allow                       # LLM can select this map for generated campaigns
  
  dependencies:
    - id: "scifi-modding-collective/space-faction-pack"
      version: "^1.0"                  # faction definitions this map references

files:
  world_map.yaml: { sha256: "..." }   # region definitions, adjacency, scenarios
  assets/galaxy_background.png: { sha256: "..." }
  assets/region_overlays.png: { sha256: "..." }
  assets/faction_icons/: {}            # per-faction marker icons
  preview.png: { sha256: "..." }       # Workshop listing thumbnail
```

Workshop world maps support the full Workshop lifecycle:

- **Discovery** — browse/search by game module, region count, theme tags, rating. Filter by "maps with 20+ regions" or "fantasy setting" or "historical."
- **One-click install** — download the `.icpkg`, world map appears in the campaign setup screen under "Community Maps."
- **Dependency resolution** — a world map can depend on faction packs, terrain packs, or sprite sets. Workshop resolves and installs dependencies automatically.
- **Versioning** — semver; breaking changes (region ID renames, adjacency changes) require major version bumps. Saved campaigns pin the world map version they were started with.
- **Forking** — any published world map can be forked. "I like that galactic map but I want to add a wormhole network" → fork, edit in Campaign Editor, republish as a derivative (license permitting).
- **LLM integration** — world maps with `ai_usage: allow` can be discovered by the LLM during campaign generation. The LLM reads region metadata (terrain types, strategic values, flavor text) to generate contextually appropriate missions. A rich, well-annotated world map gives the LLM more material to work with.
- **Composition** — a world map can reference other Workshop resources. Faction packs define the factions. Terrain packs provide the visual assets. Music packs set the atmosphere. The world map is the strategic skeleton; other Workshop resources flesh it out.
- **Rating and reviews** — community rates world maps on balance, visual quality, replayability. High-rated maps surface in "Featured" listings.

**World map as an engine feature, not a campaign feature:**

The world map renderer is in `ic-ui` — it's a general-purpose interactive map component. The World Domination campaign mode uses it as its primary interface, but the same component powers:

- The "World Map" intermission template in D038 (for non-domination campaigns that want a mission-select map)
- Strategic overview displays in Game Master mode
- Multiplayer lobby map selection (showing region-based game modes)
- Mod-defined strategic layers (e.g., a Generals mod with a global war on terror, a Star Wars mod with a galactic conquest, a fantasy mod with a continent map)

The engine imposes no assumptions about what the map represents. Regions are abstract nodes with connections, properties, and an image overlay. Whether those nodes are countries, planets, city districts, or dungeon rooms is entirely up to the content creator. The engine provides the map renderer; the game module and mods provide the map data.

Because world maps are Workshop resources, the community can build a library of strategic maps independently of the engine team. A thriving Workshop means a player launching World Domination for the first time can browse dozens of community-created maps — historical, fictional, fantastical — and start a campaign on any of them without the modder needing to ship a full game module.

#### Workshop Resource Integration

The LLM doesn't generate everything from scratch. It draws on the player's configured Workshop sources (D030) for maps, terrain packs, music, and other assets — the same pipeline described in § LLM-Driven Resource Discovery above.

**How this works in campaign generation:**

1. The LLM plans a mission: "Arctic base assault in a fjord."
2. The generation system searches Workshop: `tags=["arctic", "fjord", "base"], ai_usage=Allow`.
3. If a suitable map exists → use it as the terrain base, generate objectives/triggers/briefing on top.
4. If no map exists → generate the map from scratch (YAML terrain definition).
5. Music, ambient audio, and voice packs from Workshop enhance the atmosphere — the LLM selects thematically appropriate resources from those available.

This makes generative campaigns richer in communities with active Workshop content creators. A well-stocked Workshop full of diverse maps and assets becomes a palette the LLM paints from. Resource attribution is tracked: the campaign's `mod.yaml` lists all Workshop dependencies, crediting the original creators.

#### No LLM? Campaign Still Works

The generative campaign system follows the core D016 principle: **LLM is for creation, not for play.**

- A player with an LLM generates a campaign → plays it → it's saved as standard D021.
- A player without an LLM → imports and plays a shared campaign from Workshop. No different from playing a hand-crafted campaign.
- A player starts a generative campaign, generates 12/24 missions, then loses LLM access → the 12 generated missions are fully playable. The campaign is "shorter than planned" but complete up to that point. When LLM access returns, generation resumes from mission 12.
- A community member takes a generated 24-mission campaign, opens it in the Campaign Editor, and hand-edits missions 15–24 to improve them. No LLM needed for editing.

The LLM is a tool in the content creation pipeline — the same pipeline that includes the Scenario Editor, Campaign Editor, and hand-authored YAML. Generated campaigns are first-class citizens of the same content ecosystem.

#### Multiplayer & Co-op Generative Campaigns

Everything described above — narrative campaigns, open-ended campaigns, world domination, cinematic generation — works in multiplayer. The generative campaign system builds on D038's co-op infrastructure (Player Slots, Co-op Mission Modes, Per-Player Objectives) and the D010 snapshottable sim. These are the multiplayer modes the generative system supports:

**Co-op generative campaigns:**

Two or more players share a generative campaign. They play together, the LLM generates for all of them, and the campaign adapts to their combined performance.

```yaml
# Co-op generative campaign setup
campaign_parameters:
  mode: generative
  player_count: 2                      # 2-4 players
  co_op_mode: allied_factions          # each player controls their own faction
  # Alternative modes from D038:
  # shared_command — both control the same army
  # commander_ops — one builds, one fights
  # split_objectives — different goals on the same map
  # asymmetric — one RTS player, one GM/support

  faction_player_1: soviet
  faction_player_2: allied             # co-op doesn't mean same faction
  difficulty: hard
  campaign_type: narrative             # or open_ended, world_domination
  length: 16
  tone: serious
```

**What the LLM generates differently for co-op:**

The LLM knows it's generating for multiple players. This changes mission design:

| Aspect                   | Single-player                  | Co-op                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Map layout**           | One base, one frontline        | Multiple bases or sectors per player                                       |
| **Objectives**           | Unified objective list         | Per-player objectives + shared goals                                       |
| **Briefings**            | One briefing                   | Per-player briefings (different intel, different roles)                    |
| **Radar comms**          | Addressed to "Commander"       | Addressed to specific players by role/faction                              |
| **Dialogue choices**     | One player decides             | Each player gets their own choices; disagreements create narrative tension |
| **Character assignment** | All characters with the player | Named characters distributed across players                                |
| **Mission difficulty**   | Scaled for one                 | Scaled for combined player power + coordination challenge                  |
| **Narrative**            | One protagonist's story        | Interweaving storylines that converge at key moments                       |

**Player disagreements as narrative fuel:**

The most interesting co-op feature: **what happens when players disagree.** In a single-player campaign, the player makes all dialogue choices. In co-op, each player makes their own choices in intermissions and mid-mission dialogues. The LLM uses disagreements as narrative material:

- Player 1 wants to spare the prisoner. Player 2 wants to execute them. The LLM generates a confrontation scene between the players' commanding officers, then resolves based on a configurable rule: majority wins, mission commander decides (rotating role), or the choice splits into two consequences.
- Player 1 wants to attack the eastern front. Player 2 wants to defend the west. In World Domination mode, they can split — each player tackles a different region simultaneously (parallel missions at the same point in the campaign).
- Persistent disagreements shift character loyalties — an NPC commander who keeps getting overruled becomes resentful, potentially defecting (Campaign Event Patterns).

**Saving, pausing, and resuming co-op campaigns:**

Co-op campaigns are long. Players can't always finish in one sitting. The system supports **pause, save, and resume** for multiplayer campaigns:

```

**How multiplayer save works (technically):**

- **Mid-mission save:** Uses D010 — full sim snapshot. Both players receive the snapshot. Either player can host the resume session. The save file is a standard `.icsave` containing the sim snapshot, order history, and campaign state.
- **Between-mission save:** The natural pause point. Campaign state (D021) is serialized — roster, flags, mission graph position, world map state (if World Domination). No sim snapshot needed — the next mission hasn't started yet.
- **Campaign ownership:** The campaign is "owned" by the creating player but the save state is portable. If Player A disappears, Player B has a full local copy and can resume solo or with a new partner.

**Co-op World Domination:**

World Domination campaigns with multiple human players — each controlling a faction on the world map. The LLM generates missions for all players, weaving their actions into a shared narrative. Two modes:

| Mode                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                | Example                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allied co-op**      | Players share a team against AI factions. They coordinate attacks on different fronts simultaneously. One player attacks Berlin while the other defends Moscow.                            | 2 players (Soviet team) vs. AI (Allied + Neutral)              |
| **Competitive co-op** | Players are rival factions on the same map. Each plays their own campaign missions. When players' territories are adjacent, they fight each other. An AI faction provides a shared threat. | Player 1 (Soviet) vs. Player 2 (Allied) vs. AI (Rogue faction) |

Allied co-op World Domination is particularly compelling — two friends on voice chat, splitting their forces across a continent, coordinating strategy: "I'll push into Scandinavia if you hold the Polish border." The LLM generates missions for both fronts simultaneously, with narrative crossover: "Intelligence reports your ally has broken through in Norway. Allied forces are retreating south — expect increased resistance on your front."

**Asynchronous campaign play:**

Not every multiplayer session needs to be real-time. For players in different time zones or with unpredictable schedules, the system supports **asynchronous play** in competitive World Domination campaigns:

```yaml
async_config:
  mode: async_competitive              # players play their campaigns asynchronously
  move_deadline: 48h                   # max time before AI plays your next mission
  notification: true                   # notify when the other player has completed a mission
  ai_fallback_on_deadline: true        # AI plays your mission if you don't show up
```

How it works:

1. Player A logs in, sees the world map. The LLM (or template system) presents their next mission — an attack, defense, or narrative event.
2. Player A plays the RTS mission in real-time. The mission resolves. The campaign state updates. Notification sent to Player B.
3. Player B logs in hours/days later. They see how the map changed based on Player A's results. The LLM presents Player B's next mission based on the updated state.
4. Player B plays their mission. The map updates again. Notification sent to Player A.

The RTS missions are fully real-time (you play a complete battle). The asynchronous part is *when* each player sits down to play — not what they do when they're playing. The LLM (or strategic AI fallback) generates narrative that acknowledges the asynchronous pacing — no urgent "the enemy is attacking NOW!" when the other player won't see it for 12 hours.

**Generative challenge campaigns:**

The LLM generates short, self-contained challenges that the community can attempt and compete on:

| Challenge type       | Description                                                                                        | Competitive element                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Weekly challenge** | A generated 3-mission mini-campaign with a leaderboard. Same seed = same campaign for all players. | Score (time, casualties, objectives) |
| **Ironman run**      | A generated campaign with permadeath — no save/reload. Campaign ends when you lose.                | How far you get (mission count)      |
| **Speed campaign**   | Generated campaign optimized for speed — short missions, tight timers.                             | Total completion time                |
| **Impossible odds**  | Generated campaign where the LLM deliberately creates unfair scenarios.                            | Binary: did you survive?             |
| **Community vote**   | Players vote on campaign parameters. The LLM generates one campaign that everyone plays.           | Score leaderboard                    |

Weekly challenges reuse the same seed and LLM output — the campaign is generated once, published to the community, and everyone plays the identical missions. This is fair because the content is deterministic once generated. Leaderboards are per-challenge, stored via the community server (D052) with signed credential records.

**Spectator and observer mode:**

Live campaigns (especially co-op and competitive World Domination) can be observed:

- **Live spectator** — watch a co-op campaign in progress (delay configurable for competitive fairness). See both players' perspectives.
- **Replay spectator** — watch a completed campaign, switching between player perspectives. The replay includes all dialogue choices, intermission decisions, and world map actions.
- **Commentary mode** — a spectator can record voice commentary over a replay, creating a "let's play" package sharable on Workshop.
- **Campaign streaming** — the campaign state can be broadcast to a spectator server. Community members watch the world map update in real-time during community events.
- **Author-guided camera** — scenario authors place Spectator Bookmark modules (D038) at key map locations and wire them to triggers. Spectators cycle bookmarks with hotkeys; replays auto-cut to bookmarks at dramatic moments. Free camera remains available — bookmarks are hints, not constraints.
- **Spectator appeal as design input** — Among Us became a cultural phenomenon through streaming because social dynamics are more entertaining to *watch* than many games are to play. Modes like Mystery (accusation moments), Nemesis (escalating rivalry), and Defection (betrayal) are inherently watchable — LLM-generated dialogue, character reactions, and dramatic pivots create spectator-friendly narrative beats. This is a validation of the existing spectator infrastructure, not a new feature: the commentary mode, War Dispatches, and replay system already capture these moments. When the LLM generates campaign content, it should mark **spectator-highlight moments** (accusations, betrayals, nemesis confrontations, moral dilemmas) in the campaign save so replays can auto-cut to them.

**Co-op resilience (eliminated player engagement):**

In any co-op campaign, a critical question: what happens when one player's forces are devastated mid-mission? Among Us's insight is that eliminated players keep playing — dead crewmates complete tasks and observe. IC applies this principle: a player whose army is destroyed doesn't sit idle. Options compose from existing systems:

- **Intelligence/advisor role** — the eliminated player transitions to managing the intermission-layer intelligence network (Espionage mode) or providing strategic guidance through the shared chat. They see the full battlefield (observer perspective) and can ping locations, mark threats, and coordinate with the surviving player.
- **Reinforcement controller** — the eliminated player controls reinforcement timing and positioning for the surviving partner. They decide *when* and *where* reserve units deploy, adding a cooperative command layer.
- **Rebuild mission** — the eliminated player receives a smaller side-mission to re-establish from a secondary base or rally point. Success in the side-mission provides reinforcements to the surviving player's main mission.
- **Game Master lite** — using the scenario's reserve pool, the eliminated player places emergency supply drops, triggers scripted reinforcements, or activates defensive structures. A subset of Game Master (D038) powers, scoped to assist rather than control.

The specific role available depends on the campaign mode and scenario design. The key principle: **no player should ever watch an empty screen in a co-op campaign**. Even total military defeat is a phase transition, not an ejection.

**Generative multiplayer scenarios (non-campaign):**

Beyond campaigns, the LLM generates one-off multiplayer scenarios:

- **Generated skirmish maps** — "Generate a 4-player free-for-all map with lots of chokepoints and limited resources." The LLM creates a balanced multiplayer map.
- **Generated team scenarios** — "Create a 2v2 co-op defense mission against waves of enemies." The LLM generates a PvE scenario with scaling difficulty.
- **Generated party modes** — "Make a king-of-the-hill map where the hill moves every 5 minutes." Creative game modes generated on demand.
- **Tournament map packs** — "Generate 7 balanced 1v1 maps for a tournament, varied terrain, no water." A set of maps with consistent quality and design language.

These generate as standard IC content — the same maps and scenarios that human designers create. They can be played immediately, saved, edited, or published to Workshop.

#### Persistent Heroes & Named Squads

The infrastructure for hero-centric, squad-based campaigns with long-term character development is fully supported by existing systems — no new engine features required. Everything described below composes from D021 (persistent rosters), D016 (character construction + CharacterState), D029 (component library), the veterancy system, and YAML/Lua modding.

**What the engine already provides:**

| Capability                            | Source                                         | How it applies                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Named units persist across missions   | D021 carryover modes                           | A hero unit that survives mission 3 is the *same entity* in mission 15 — same health, same veterancy, same kill count                                                                                                    |
| Veterancy accumulates permanently     | D021 + veterancy system                        | A commando who kills 50 enemies across 10 missions earns promotions that change their stats, voice lines, and visual appearance                                                                                          |
| Permanent death                       | D021 + CharacterState                          | If Volkov dies in mission 7, `CharacterStatus::Dead` — he's gone forever. The campaign adapts around his absence. No reloading in Iron Man mode.                                                                         |
| Character personality persists        | D016 CharacterState                            | MBTI type, speech style, flaw/desire/fear, loyalty, relationship — all tracked and evolved by the LLM across the full campaign                                                                                           |
| Characters react to their own history | D016 battle reports + narrative threads        | A hero who was nearly killed in mission 5 develops caution. One who was betrayed develops trust issues. The LLM reads `notable_events` and adjusts behavior.                                                             |
| Squad composition matters             | D021 roster + D029 components                  | A hand-picked 5-unit squad with complementary abilities (commando + engineer + sniper + medic + demolitions) plays differently than a conventional army. Equipment captured in one mission equips the squad in the next. |
| Upgrades and equipment persist        | D021 equipment carryover + D029 upgrade system | A hero's captured experimental weapon, earned battlefield upgrades, and scavenged equipment carry forward permanently                                                                                                    |
| Customizable unit identity            | YAML unit definitions + Lua                    | Named units can have custom names, visual markings (kill tallies, custom insignia via Lua), and unique voice lines                                                                                                       |

**Campaign modes this enables:**

**Commando campaign ("Tanya Mode"):** A series of behind-enemy-lines missions with 1–3 hero units and no base building. Every mission is a commando operation. The heroes accumulate kills, earn abilities, and develop personality through LLM-generated briefing dialogue. Losing your commando ends the campaign (Iron Man) or branches to a rescue mission (standard). The LLM generates increasingly personal rivalry between your commando and an enemy commander who's hunting them.

**Squad campaign ("Band of Brothers"):** A persistent squad of 5–12 named soldiers. Each squad member has an MBTI personality, a role specialization, and a relationship to the others. Between missions, the LLM generates squad interactions — arguments, bonding moments, confessions, humor — driven by MBTI dynamics and recent battle events. A medic (ISFJ) who saved the sniper (INTJ) in mission 4 develops a protective bond. The demolitions expert (ESTP) and the squad leader (ISTJ) clash over tactics. When a squad member dies, the LLM writes the other characters' grief responses consistent with their personalities and relationships. Replacements arrive — but they're new personalities who have to earn the squad's trust.

**Hero army campaign ("Generals"):** A conventional campaign where 3–5 hero units lead a full army. Heroes are special units with unique abilities, voice lines, and narrative arcs. They appear in briefings, issue orders to the player, argue with each other about strategy, and can be sent on solo objectives within larger missions. Losing a hero doesn't end the campaign but permanently changes it — the army loses a capability, the other heroes react, and the enemy adapts.

**Cross-campaign hero persistence ("Legacy"):** Heroes from a completed campaign carry over to the next campaign. A veteran commando from "Soviet Campaign" appears as a grizzled mentor in "Soviet Campaign 2" — with their full history, personality evolution, and kill count. `CharacterState` serializes to campaign save files and can be imported. The LLM reads the imported history and writes the character accordingly — a war hero is treated like a war hero.

**Iron Man integration:** All hero modes compose with Iron Man (no save/reload). Death is permanent. The campaign adapts. This is where the character investment pays off most intensely — the player who nursed a hero through 15 missions has real emotional stakes when that hero is sent into a dangerous situation. The LLM knows this and uses it: "Volkov volunteers for the suicide mission. He's your best commando. But if he goes in alone, he won't come back."

**Modding support:** All of this is achievable through YAML + Lua (Tier 1-2 modding). A modder defines named hero units in YAML with custom stats, abilities, and visual markings. Lua scripts handle special hero abilities ("Volkov plants the charges — 30-second timer"), squad interaction triggers, and custom carryover rules. The LLM's character construction system works with any modder-defined units — the MBTI framework and flaw/desire/fear triangle apply regardless of the game module. A Total Conversion mod in a fantasy setting could have a persistent party of heroes with swords instead of guns — the personality simulation works the same way.

#### Extended Generative Campaign Modes

The three core generative modes — **Narrative** (fixed-length), **Open-Ended** (condition-driven), and **World Domination** (world map + LLM narrative director) — are the structural foundations. But the LLM's expressive range and IC's compositional architecture enable a much wider vocabulary of campaign experiences. Each mode below composes from existing systems (D021 branching, CharacterState, MBTI dynamics, battle reports, roster persistence, story flags, world map renderer, Workshop resources) — no new engine changes required.

These modes are drawn from the deepest wells of human storytelling: philosophy, cinema, literature, military history, game design, and the universal experiences that make stories resonate across cultures. The test for each: **does it make the toy soldiers come alive in a way no other mode does?**

**The Long March (Survival Exodus)**

*Inspired by: Battlestar Galactica, FTL: Faster Than Light, the Biblical Exodus, Xenophon's Anabasis, the real Long March, Oregon Trail, refugee crises throughout history.*

You're not conquering — you're surviving. Your army has been shattered, your homeland overrun. You must lead what remains of your people across hostile territory to safety. Every mission is a waypoint on a desperate journey. The world map shows your route — not territory you hold, but ground you must cross.

The LLM generates waypoint encounters: ambushes at river crossings, abandoned supply depots (trap or salvation?), hostile garrisons blocking mountain passes, civilian populations who might shelter you or sell you out. The defining tension is **resource scarcity** — you can't replace what you lose. A tank destroyed in mission 4 is gone forever. A hero killed at the third river crossing never reaches the promised land. Every engagement forces a calculation: fight (risk losses), sneak (risk detection), or negotiate (risk betrayal).

What makes this profoundly different from conquest modes: the emotional arc is inverted. In a normal campaign, the player grows stronger. Here, the player holds on. Victory isn't domination — it's survival. The LLM tracks the convoy's dwindling strength and generates missions that match: early missions are organized retreats with rear-guard actions; mid-campaign missions are desperate scavenging operations; late missions are harrowing last stands at chokepoints. The finale isn't assaulting the enemy capital — it's crossing the final border with whatever you have left.

Every unit that makes it to the end feels earned. A veteran tank that survived 20 missions of running battles, ambushes, and near-misses isn't just a unit — it's a story.

| Aspect        | Solo                                        | Multiplayer                                                                                                                            |

**Cold War Espionage (The Intelligence Campaign)**

*Inspired by: John le Carré (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), The Americans (TV), Bridge of Spies, Metal Gear Solid, the real Cold War intelligence apparatus.*

The war is fought with purpose. Every mission is a full RTS engagement — Extract→Build→Amass→Crush — but the *objectives* are intelligence-driven. You assault a fortified compound to extract a defecting scientist before the enemy can evacuate them. You defend a relay station for 15 minutes while your signals team intercepts a critical transmission. You raid a convoy to capture communications equipment that reveals the next enemy offensive. The LLM generates these intelligence-flavored objectives, but what the player actually *does* is build bases, train armies, and fight battles.

Between missions, the player manages an intelligence network in the intermission layer. The LLM generates a web of agents, double agents, handlers, and informants, each with MBTI-driven motivations that determine when they cooperate, when they lie, and when they defect. Each recruited agent has a loyalty score, a personality type, and a price. An ISFJ agent spies out of duty but breaks under moral pressure. An ENTP agent spies for the thrill but gets bored with routine operations. The LLM uses these personality models to simulate when an agent provides good intelligence, when they feed disinformation (intentionally or under duress), and when they get burned.

Intelligence gathered between missions shapes the next battle. Good intel reveals enemy base locations, unlocks alternative starting positions, weakens enemy forces through pre-mission sabotage, or provides reinforcement timelines. Bad intel — from burned agents or double agents feeding disinformation — sends the player into missions with false intelligence: the enemy base isn't where your agent said it was, the "lightly defended" outpost is a trap, the reinforcements that were supposed to arrive don't exist. The campaign's strategic metagame is information quality; the moment-to-moment gameplay is commanding armies.

The MBTI interaction system drives the intermission layer: every agent conversation is a negotiation, every character is potentially lying, and reading people's personalities correctly determines the quality of intel you bring into battle. Petrov (ISTJ) can be trusted because duty-bound types don't betray without extreme cause. Sonya (ENTJ) is useful but dangerous — her ambition makes her a powerful asset and an unpredictable risk. The LLM simulates these dynamics through dialogue that reveals (or conceals) character intentions based on their personality models.

| Aspect                | Solo                                                                    | Multiplayer                                                                                                                        |

**The Defection (Two Wars in One)**

*Inspired by: The Americans, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Bridge of Spies, real Cold War defection stories (Oleg Gordievsky, Aldrich Ames), Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Finn's defection).*

Act 1: You fight for one side. You know your commanders. You trust (or distrust) your team. You fight the enemy as defined by your faction. Then something happens — an order you can't follow, a truth you can't ignore, an atrocity that changes everything. Act 2: You defect. Everything inverts. Your former allies hunt you with the tactics you taught them. Your new allies don't trust you. The characters you built relationships with in Act 1 react to your betrayal according to their MBTI types — the ISTJ commander feels personally betrayed, the ESTP commando grudgingly respects your courage, the ENTJ intelligence officer was expecting it and already has a contingency plan.

What makes this structurally unique: the same CharacterState instances exist in both acts, but their `allegiance` and `relationship_to_player` values flip. The LLM generates Act 2 dialogue where former friends reference specific events from Act 1 — "I trusted you at the bridge, Commander. I won't make that mistake again." The personality system ensures each character's reaction to the defection is psychologically consistent: some hunt you with rage, some with sorrow, some with professional detachment.

The defection trigger can be player-chosen (a moral crisis) or narrative-driven (you discover your faction's war crimes). The LLM builds toward it across Act 1 — uncomfortable orders, suspicious intelligence, moral gray areas — so it feels earned, not arbitrary. The `hidden_agenda` field and `loyalty` score track the player's growing doubts through story flags.

| Aspect             | Solo                                                                       | Multiplayer                                                                                                                   |

| **Tension**        | Your knowledge of your old faction is your weapon — and your vulnerability | The betrayal is social, not just narrative. Your co-op partner didn't expect you to switch sides.                             |

**Nemesis (The Personal War)**

*Inspired by: Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system, Captain Ahab and the white whale (Moby-Dick), Holmes/Moriarty, Batman/Joker, Heat (Mann), the primal human experience of rivalry.*

The entire campaign is structured around a single, escalating rivalry with an enemy commander who adapts, learns, remembers, and grows. The Nemesis isn't a scripted boss — they're a fully realized CharacterState with an MBTI personality, their own flaw/desire/fear triangle, and a relationship to the player that evolves based on actual battle outcomes.

The LLM reads every battle report and updates the Nemesis's behavior. Player loves tank rushes? The Nemesis develops anti-armor obsession — mines every approach, builds AT walls, taunts the player about predictability. Player won convincingly in mission 5? The Nemesis retreats to rebuild, and the LLM generates 2-3 missions of fragile peace before the Nemesis returns with a new strategy and a grudge. Player barely wins? The Nemesis respects the challenge and begins treating the war as a personal duel rather than a strategic campaign.

What separates this from the existing "Rival commander" pattern: the Nemesis IS the campaign. Not a subplot — the main plot. The arc follows the classical rivalry structure: introduction (missions 1-3), first confrontation (4-5), escalation (6-12), reversal (the Nemesis wins one — 13-14), obsession (15-18), and final reckoning (19-24). Both characters are changed by the end. The LLM generates the Nemesis's personal narrative — their own setbacks, alliances, and moral evolution — and delivers fragments through intercepted communications, captured intel, and enemy officer interrogations.

The deepest philosophical parallel: the Nemesis is a mirror. Their MBTI type is deliberately chosen as the player's faction's shadow — strategically complementary, personally incompatible. An INTJ strategic mastermind opposing the player's blunt-force army creates a "brains vs. brawn" struggle. An ENFP charismatic rebel opposing the player's disciplined advance creates "heart vs. machine." The LLM makes the Nemesis compelling enough that defeating them feels bittersweet.

| Aspect         | Solo                                                                                                                | Multiplayer                                                                                |

**Moral Complexity Parameter (Tactical Dilemmas)**

*Inspired by: Spec Ops: The Line (tonal caution), Papers Please (systemic moral choices), the trolley problem (Philippa Foot), Walzer's "Just and Unjust Wars," the enduring human interest in difficult decisions under pressure.*

Moral complexity is not a standalone campaign mode — it's a **parameter available on any generative campaign mode**. It controls how often the LLM generates tactical dilemmas with no clean answer, and how much character personality drives the fallout. Three levels:

- **Low** (default): Straightforward tactical choices. The mission has a clear objective; characters react to victory and defeat but not to moral ambiguity. Standard C&C fare — good guys, bad guys, blow stuff up.
- **Medium**: Tactical trade-offs with character consequences. Occasional missions present two valid approaches with different costs. Destroy the bridge to cut off enemy reinforcements, or leave it intact so civilians can evacuate? The choice affects the next mission's conditions AND how your MBTI-typed commanders view your leadership. No wrong answer — but each choice shifts character loyalty.
- **High**: Genuine moral weight with long-tail consequences. The LLM generates dilemmas where both options have defensible logic and painful costs. Tactical, not gratuitous — these stay within the toy-soldier abstraction of C&C:
  - A fortified enemy position is using a civilian structure as cover. Shelling it ends the siege quickly but your ISFJ field commander loses respect for your methods. Flanking costs time and units but preserves your team's trust.
  - You've intercepted intelligence that an enemy officer wants to defect — but extracting them requires diverting forces from a critical defensive position. Commit to the extraction (gain a valuable asset, risk the defense) or hold the line (lose the defector, secure the front).
  - Two allied positions are under simultaneous attack. You can only reinforce one in time. The LLM ensures both positions have named characters the player has built relationships with. Whoever you don't reinforce takes heavy casualties — and remembers.

The LLM tracks choices in campaign story flags and generates **long-tail consequences**. A choice from mission 3 might resurface in mission 15 — the officer you extracted becomes a critical ally, or the position you didn't reinforce never fully trusts your judgment again. Characters react according to their MBTI type: TJ types evaluate consequences; FP types evaluate intent; SJ types evaluate duty; NP types evaluate principle. Loyalty shifts based on personality-consistent moral frameworks, not a universal morality scale.

At **High** in co-op campaigns, both players must agree on dilemma choices — creating genuine social negotiation. "Do we divert for the extraction or hold the line?" becomes a real conversation between real people with different strategic instincts.

This parameter composes with every mode: a Nemesis campaign at High moral complexity generates dilemmas where the Nemesis exploits the player's past choices. A Generational Saga at High carries moral consequences across generations — Generation 3 lives with Generation 1's trade-offs. A Mystery campaign at Medium lets the traitor steer the player toward choices that look reasonable but serve enemy interests.

**Generational Saga (The Hundred-Year War)**

*Inspired by: Crusader Kings (Paradox), Foundation (Asimov), Dune (Herbert), The Godfather trilogy, Fire Emblem (permadeath + inheritance), the lived experience of generational trauma and inherited conflict.*

The war spans three generations. Each generation is ~8 missions. Characters age, retire, die of old age or in combat. Young lieutenants from Generation 1 are old generals in Generation 3. The decisions of grandparents shape the world their grandchildren inherit.

Generation 1 establishes the conflict. The player's commanders are young, idealistic, sometimes reckless. Their victories and failures set the starting conditions for everything that follows. The LLM generates the world state that Generation 2 inherits: borders drawn by Generation 1's campaigns, alliances forged by their diplomacy, grudges created by their atrocities, technology unlocked by their captured facilities.

Generation 2 lives in their predecessors' shadow. The LLM generates characters who are the children or proteges of Generation 1's heroes — with inherited MBTIs modified by upbringing. A legendary commander's daughter might be an ENTJ like her father... or an INFP who rejects everything he stood for. The Nemesis from Generation 1 might be dead, but their successor inherited their grudge and their tactical files. "Your father destroyed my father's army at Stalingrad. I've spent 20 years studying how."

Generation 3 brings resolution. The war's original cause may be forgotten — the LLM tracks how meaning shifts across generations. What started as liberation becomes occupation becomes tradition becomes identity. The final generation must either find peace or perpetuate a war that nobody remembers starting. The LLM generates characters who question why they're fighting — and the MBTI system determines who accepts "it's always been this way" (SJ types) and who demands "but why?" (NP types).

Cross-campaign hero persistence (Legacy mode) provides the technical infrastructure. CharacterState serializes between generations. Veterancy, notable events, and relationship history persist in the save. The LLM writes Generation 3's dialogue with explicit callbacks to Generation 1's battles — events the *player* remembers but the *characters* only know as stories.

**Parallel Timelines (The Chronosphere Fracture)**

*Inspired by: Sliding Doors (film), Everything Everywhere All at Once, Bioshock Infinite, the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, the universal human experience of "what if I'd chosen differently?"*

This mode is uniquely suited to Red Alert's lore — the Chronosphere is literally a time machine. A Chronosphere malfunction fractures reality into two parallel timelines diverging from a single critical decision. The player alternates missions between Timeline A (where they made one choice) and Timeline B (where they made the opposite).

The LLM generates both timelines from the same campaign skeleton but with diverging consequences. In Timeline A, you destroyed the bridge — the enemy can't advance, but your reinforcements can't reach you either. In Timeline B, you saved the bridge — the enemy pours across, but so do your reserves. The same characters exist in both timelines but develop differently based on divergent circumstances. Sonya (ENTJ) in Timeline A seizes power during the chaos; Sonya in Timeline B remains loyal because the bridge gave her the resources she needed. Same personality, different circumstances, different trajectory — the MBTI system ensures both versions are psychologically plausible.

The player experiences both consequences simultaneously. Every 2 missions, the timeline switches. The LLM generates narrative parallels and contrasts — events that rhyme across timelines. Mission 6A is a desperate defense; Mission 6B is an easy victory. But the easy victory in B created a complacency that sets up a devastating ambush in 8B, while the desperate defense in A forged a harder, warier force that handles 8A better. The timelines teach different lessons.

The climax: the timelines threaten to collapse into each other (Chronosphere overload). The player must choose which timeline becomes "real" — with full knowledge of what they're giving up. Or, in the boldest variant, the two timelines collide and the player must fight their way through a reality-fractured final mission where enemies and allies from both timelines coexist.

| Aspect        | Solo                                                  | Multiplayer                                                                                                                        |

**The Mystery (Whodunit at War)**

*Inspired by: Agatha Christie, The Thing (Carpenter), Among Us, Clue, Knives Out, the universal human fascination with deduction and betrayal.*

Someone in your own command structure is sabotaging operations. Missions keep going wrong in ways that can't be explained by bad luck — the enemy always knows your plans, supply convoys vanish, key systems fail at critical moments. The campaign is simultaneously a military campaign and a murder mystery. The player must figure out which of their named characters is the traitor — while still winning a war.

The LLM randomly selects the traitor at campaign start from the named cast and plays that character's MBTI type *as if they were loyal* — because a good traitor acts normal. But the LLM plants clues in mission outcomes and character behavior. An ISFJ traitor might "accidentally" route supplies to the wrong location (duty-driven guilt creates mistakes). An ENTJ traitor might push too hard for a specific strategic decision that happens to benefit the enemy (ambition overrides subtlety). An ESTP traitor makes bold, impulsive moves that look like heroism but create exploitable vulnerabilities.

The player gathers evidence through mission outcomes, character dialogue inconsistencies, and optional investigation objectives (hack a communications relay, interrogate a captured enemy, search a character's quarters). At various points the campaign offers "accuse" branching — name the traitor and take action. Accuse correctly → the conspiracy unravels and the campaign pivots to hunting the traitor's handlers. Accuse incorrectly → you've just purged a loyal officer, damaged morale, and the real traitor is still operating. The LLM generates the fallout either way.

What makes this work with MBTI: each character type hides guilt differently, leaks information differently, and responds to suspicion differently. The LLM generates behavioral tells that are personality-consistent — learnable but not obvious. Repeat playthroughs with the same characters but a different traitor create genuinely different mystery experiences because the deception patterns change with the traitor's personality type.

**Marination — trust before betrayal:** The LLM follows a deliberate escalation curve inspired by Among Us's best impostors. The traitor character performs *exceptionally well* in early missions — perhaps saving the player from a tough situation, providing critical intelligence, or volunteering for dangerous assignments. The first 30–40% of the campaign builds genuine trust. Clues begin appearing only after the player has formed a real attachment to every character (including the traitor). In co-op Traitor mode, divergent objectives start trivially small — capture a minor building that barely affects the mission outcome — and escalate gradually as the campaign progresses. This ensures the eventual reveal feels earned rather than random, and the player's "I trusted you" reaction has genuine emotional weight.

| Aspect        | Solo                                                  | Multiplayer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Structure** | Player deduces the traitor from clues across missions | Co-op with explicit opt-in "Traitor" party mode: one player receives secret *divergent* objectives from the LLM (capture instead of destroy, let a specific unit escape, secure a specific building). Not sabotage — different priorities. |
| **Tension**   | "Which of my commanders is lying to me?"              | "Is my co-op partner pursuing a different objective, or are we playing the same mission?" Subtle divergence, not griefing.                                                                                                                 |
| **Climax**    | The accusation — right or wrong, the campaign changes | The reveal — when divergent objectives surface, the campaign's entire history is recontextualized. Both players were playing their own version of the war.                                                                                 |

**Verifiable actions (trust economy):** In co-op Traitor mode, the system tracks **verifiable actions** — things that both players can confirm through shared battlefield data. "I defended the northern flank solo for 8 minutes" is system-confirmable from the replay. "I captured objective Alpha as requested" appears in the shared mission summary. A player building trust spends time on verifiable actions visible to their partner — but this diverts from optimal play or from pursuing secret divergent objectives. The traitor faces a genuine strategic choice: build trust through verifiable actions (slower divergent progress, safer cover) or pursue secret objectives aggressively (faster but riskier if the partner is watching closely). This creates an Among Us-style "visual tasks" dynamic where proving innocence has a real cost.

**Intelligence review (structured suspicion moments):** In co-op Mystery campaigns, each intermission functions as an **intelligence review** — a structured moment where both players see a summary of mission outcomes and the LLM surfaces anomalies. "Objective Alpha was captured instead of destroyed — consistent with enemy priorities." "Forces were diverted from Sector 7 during the final push — 12% efficiency loss." The system generates this data automatically from divergent-objective tracking and presents it neutrally. Players discuss before the next mission — creating a natural accusation-or-trust moment without pausing gameplay. This mirrors Among Us's emergency meeting mechanic: action stops, evidence is reviewed, and players must decide whether to confront suspicion or move on.

**Asymmetric briefings (information asymmetry in all co-op modes):** Beyond Mystery, ALL co-op campaign modes benefit from a lesson Among Us teaches about information asymmetry: **each player's pre-mission briefing should include information the other player doesn't have**. Player A's intelligence report mentions an enemy weapons cache in the southeast; Player B's report warns of reinforcements arriving from the north. Neither briefing is wrong — they're simply incomplete. This creates natural "wait, what did YOUR briefing say?" conversations that build cooperative engagement. In Mystery co-op, asymmetric briefings also provide cover for the traitor's divergent objectives — they can claim "my briefing said to capture that building" and the other player can't immediately verify it. The LLM generates briefing splits based on each player's assigned intelligence network and agent roster.

#### Solo–Multiplayer Bridges

The modes above work as standalone solo or multiplayer experiences. But the most interesting innovation is allowing **ideas to cross between solo and multiplayer** — things you create alone become part of someone else's experience, and vice versa. These bridges emerge naturally from IC's existing architecture (CharacterState serialization, Workshop sharing, D042 player behavioral profiles, campaign save portability):

**Nemesis Export:** Complete a Nemesis campaign. Your nemesis — their MBTI personality, their adapted tactics (learned from your battle reports), their grudge, their dialogue patterns — serializes to a Workshop-sharable character file. Another player imports your nemesis into their own campaign. Now they're fighting a villain that was forged by YOUR gameplay. The nemesis "remembers" their history and references it: "The last commander who tried that tactic... I made them regret it." Community-curated nemesis libraries let players challenge themselves against the most compelling villain characters the community has generated.

**Ghost Operations (Asynchronous Competition):** A solo player completes a campaign. Their campaign save — including every tactical decision, unit composition, timing, and outcome — becomes a "ghost." Another player plays the same campaign seed but races against the ghost's performance. Not a replay — a parallel run. The ghost's per-mission results appear as benchmark data: "The ghost completed this mission in 12 minutes with 3 casualties. Can you do better?" This transforms solo campaigns into asynchronous races. Weekly challenges already use fixed seeds; ghost operations extend this to full campaigns.

**War Dispatches (Narrative Fragments):** A solo player's campaign generates "dispatches" — short, LLM-written narrative summaries of key campaign moments, formatted as fictional news reports, radio intercepts, or intelligence briefings. These dispatches are shareable. Other players can subscribe to a friend's campaign dispatches — following their war as a serialized story. A dispatch might say: "Reports confirm the destruction of the 3rd Allied Armored Division at the Rhine crossing. Soviet commander [player name] is advancing unchecked." The reader sees the story; the player lived it.

**Community Front Lines (Persistent World):** Every solo player's World Domination campaign contributes to a shared community war map. Your victories advance your faction's front lines; your defeats push them back. Weekly aggregation: the community's collective Solo campaigns determine the global state. Weekly community briefings (LLM-generated from aggregate data) report on the state of the war. "The Allied front in Northern Europe has collapsed after 847 Soviet campaign victories this week. The community's attention shifts to the Pacific theater." This doesn't affect individual campaigns — it's a metagame visualization. But it creates the feeling that your solo campaign matters to something larger.

**Tactical DNA (D042 Profile as Challenge):** Complete a campaign. Your D042 player behavioral profile — which tracks your strategic tendencies, unit preferences, micro patterns — exports as a "tactical DNA" file. An AI opponent can load your tactical DNA and play *as you*. Another player can challenge your tactical DNA: "Can you beat the AI version of Copilot? They love air rushes, never build naval, and always go for the tech tree." This creates asymmetric AI opponents that are genuinely personal — not generic difficulty levels, but specific human-like play patterns. Community members share and compete against each other's tactical DNA in skirmish mode.

All extended modes produce standard D021 campaigns. All are playable without an LLM once generated. All are saveable, shareable via Workshop, editable in the Campaign Editor, and replayable. The LLM provides the creative act; the engine provides the infrastructure. Modders can create new modes by combining the same building blocks differently — the modes above are a curated library, not an exhaustive list.

> **See also D057 (Skill Library):** Proven mission generation patterns — which scene template combinations, parameter values, and narrative structures produce highly-rated missions — are stored in the skill library and retrieved as few-shot examples for future generation. This makes D016's template-filling approach more reliable over time without changing the generation architecture.

## D017: Bevy Rendering Pipeline — Classic Base, Modding Possibilities

**Decision:** Use Bevy's rendering pipeline (wgpu) to faithfully reproduce the classic Red Alert isometric aesthetic. Bevy's more advanced rendering capabilities (shaders, post-processing, dynamic lighting, particles, 3D) are available as modding infrastructure — not as base game goals.

**Rationale:**
- The core rendering goal is a faithful classic Red Alert clone: isometric sprites, palette-aware shading, fog of war
- Bevy + wgpu provides this solidly via 2D sprite batching and the isometric layer
- Because Bevy includes a full rendering pipeline, advanced visual capabilities (bloom, color grading, GPU particles, dynamic lighting, custom shaders) are **passively available** to modders without extra engine work
- This enables community-created visual enhancements: shader effects for chrono-shift, tesla arcs, weather particles, or even full 3D rendering mods (see D018, `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "3D Rendering as a Mod")
- Render quality tiers (Baseline → Ultra) automatically degrade for older hardware — the base classic aesthetic works on all tiers

**Scope:**
- Phase 1: faithful isometric tile renderer, sprite animation, shroud, camera — showcase optional post-processing prototypes to demonstrate modding potential
- Phase 3+: rendering supports whatever the game chrome needs
- Phase 7: visual modding infrastructure (particle systems, shader library, weather rendering) — tools for modders, not base game goals

**Design principle:** The base game looks like Red Alert. Modders can make it look like whatever they want.

## D018: Multi-Game Extensibility (Game Modules)

**Decision:** Design the engine as a game-agnostic RTS framework that ships with multiple built-in game modules. Red Alert is the default module; Tiberian Dawn ships alongside it. RA2, Tiberian Sun, Dune 2000, and original games should be addable as additional modules without modifying core engine code. The engine is also capable of powering non-C&C classic RTS games (see D039).

**Rationale:**
- OpenRA already proves multi-game works — runs TD, RA, and D2K on one engine via different trait/component sets
- The ECS architecture naturally supports this (composable components, pluggable systems)
- Prevents RA1 assumptions from hardening into architectural constraints that require rewrites later
- Broadens the project's audience and contributor base
- RA2 is the most-requested extension — community interest is proven (Chrono Divide exists)
- Shipping RA + TD from the start (like OpenRA) proves the game-agnostic design is real, not aspirational
- **Validated by Factorio's "game is a mod" principle:** Factorio's `base/` directory uses the exact same `data:extend()` API available to external mods — the base game is literally a mod. This is the strongest possible validation of the game module architecture. IC's RA1 module must use NO internal APIs unavailable to external game modules. Every system it uses — pathfinding, fog of war, damage resolution, format loading — should go through `GameModule` trait registration, not internal engine shortcuts. If the RA1 module needs a capability that external modules can't access, that capability must be promoted to a public trait or API. See `research/mojang-wube-modding-analysis.md` § "The Game Is a Mod"

**The `GameModule` trait:**

Every game module implements `GameModule`, which bundles everything the engine needs to run that game:

```rust
pub trait GameModule: Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Human-readable name ("Red Alert", "Tiberian Dawn")
    fn name(&self) -> &str;

    /// Register ECS components, systems, and system ordering
    fn register_systems(&self, app: &mut App);

    /// Provide the module's Pathfinder implementation
    fn pathfinder(&self) -> Box<dyn Pathfinder>;

    /// Provide the module's SpatialIndex implementation
    fn spatial_index(&self) -> Box<dyn SpatialIndex>;

    /// Provide the module's FogProvider implementation (D041)
    fn fog_provider(&self) -> Box<dyn FogProvider>;

    /// Provide the module's DamageResolver implementation (D041)
    fn damage_resolver(&self) -> Box<dyn DamageResolver>;

    /// Provide the module's OrderValidator implementation (D041)
    fn order_validator(&self) -> Box<dyn OrderValidator>;

    /// Provide the module's render plugin (sprite, voxel, 3D, etc.)
    fn render_plugin(&self) -> Box<dyn RenderPlugin>;

    /// List available render modes — Classic, HD, 3D, etc. (D048)
    fn render_modes(&self) -> Vec<RenderMode>;

    /// Provide the module's UI layout (sidebar style, build queue, etc.)
    fn ui_layout(&self) -> UiLayout;

    /// Provide format loaders for this module's asset types
    fn format_loaders(&self) -> Vec<Box<dyn FormatLoader>>;

    /// Register game-module-specific commands into the Brigadier command tree (D058).
    /// RA1 registers `/sell`, `/deploy`, `/stance`, etc. A total conversion registers
    /// its own novel commands. Engine built-in commands are pre-registered before this.
    fn register_commands(&self, dispatcher: &mut CommandDispatcher);

    /// List available balance presets (D019)
    fn balance_presets(&self) -> Vec<BalancePreset>;

    /// List available experience profiles (D019 + D032 + D033 + D043 + D045 + D048)
    fn experience_profiles(&self) -> Vec<ExperienceProfile>;

    /// Default experience profile name
    fn default_profile(&self) -> &str;
}
```

Profiles are selectable in the lobby. Players can customize individual settings or pick a preset. Competitive modes lock the profile for fairness — specifically:

| D048 Render mode         | **No** — client-only cosmetic         | No sim impact; cross-view multiplayer is architecturally safe (see D048 § "Information Equivalence")              |
| D033 QoL (client-only)   | **No** — per-player preferences       | Health bar display, selection glow, etc. — purely visual/UX, no competitive advantage                             |

The locked axes collectively ensure that all ranked players share identical simulation rules. The unlocked axes are guaranteed to be information-equivalent (see D048 § "Information Equivalence" and D058 § "Visual Settings & Competitive Fairness").

**Concrete changes (baked in from Phase 0):**
1. `WorldPos` carries a Z coordinate from day one (RA1 sets z=0). `CellPos` is a game-module convenience for grid-based games, not an engine-core type.
2. System execution order is registered per game module, not hardcoded in engine
3. No game-specific enums in engine core — resource types, unit categories come from YAML / module registration
4. Renderer uses a `Renderable` trait — sprite and voxel backends implement it equally
5. Pathfinding uses a `Pathfinder` trait — `IcPathfinder` (multi-layer hybrid) is the RA1 impl; navmesh could slot in without touching sim
6. Spatial queries use a `SpatialIndex` trait — spatial hash is the RA1 impl; BVH/R-tree could slot in without touching combat/targeting
7. `GameModule` trait bundles component registration, system pipeline, pathfinder, spatial index, fog provider, damage resolver, order validator, format loaders, render backends, and experience profiles (see D041 for the 5 additional trait abstractions)
8. `PlayerOrder` is extensible to game-specific commands
9. Engine crates use `ic-*` naming (not `ra-*`) to reflect game-agnostic identity (see D039). Exception: `ra-formats` stays because it reads C&C-family file formats specifically.

**What this does NOT mean:**
- We don't build RA2 support now. Red Alert + Tiberian Dawn are the focus through Phase 3-4.
- We don't add speculative abstractions. Only the nine concrete changes above.
- Non-C&C game modules are an architectural capability, not a deliverable (see D039).

**Scope boundary — current targets vs. architectural openness:**
First-party game module development targets the C&C family: Red Alert (default, ships Phase 2), Tiberian Dawn (ships Phase 3-4 stretch goal). RA2, Tiberian Sun, and Dune 2000 are future community goals sharing the isometric camera, grid-based terrain, sprite/voxel rendering, and `.mix` format lineage.

**3D titles (Generals, C&C3, RA3) are not current targets** but the architecture deliberately avoids closing doors. With pathfinding (`Pathfinder` trait), spatial queries (`SpatialIndex` trait), rendering (`Renderable` trait), camera (`ScreenToWorld` trait), format loading (`FormatRegistry`), fog of war (`FogProvider` trait), damage resolution (`DamageResolver` trait), AI (`AiStrategy` trait), and order validation (`OrderValidator` trait) all behind pluggable abstractions, a Generals-class game module would provide its own implementations of these traits while reusing the sim core, networking, modding infrastructure, workshop, competitive systems, replays, and save games. The traits exist from day one — the cost is near-zero, and the benefit is that neither we nor the community need to fork the engine to explore continuous-space games in the future. See D041 for the full trait-abstraction strategy and rationale.

See `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Architectural Openness: Beyond Isometric" for the full trait-by-trait breakdown.

However, **3D rendering mods for isometric-family games are explicitly supported.** A "3D Red Alert" Tier 3 mod can replace sprites with GLTF meshes and the isometric camera with a free 3D camera — without changing the sim, networking, or pathfinding. Bevy's built-in 3D pipeline makes this feasible. Cross-view multiplayer (2D vs 3D players in the same game) works because the sim is view-agnostic. See `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "3D Rendering as a Mod".

**Phase:** Architecture baked in from Phase 0. RA1 module ships Phase 2. TD module targets Phase 3-4 as a stretch goal. RA2 module is a potential Phase 8+ community project.

> **Expectation management:** The community's most-requested feature is RA2 support. The architecture deliberately supports it (game-agnostic traits, extensible ECS, pluggable pathfinding), but **RA2 is a future community goal, not a scheduled deliverable.** No timeline, staffing, or exit criteria exist for any game module beyond RA1 and TD. When the community reads "game-agnostic," they should understand: the architecture won't block RA2, but nobody is building it yet. TD ships alongside RA1 to prove the multi-game design works — not because two games are twice as fun, but because an engine that only runs one game hasn't proven it's game-agnostic.

## D019: Switchable Balance Presets (Classic RA vs OpenRA)

**Decision:** Ship multiple balance presets as first-class YAML rule sets. Default to classic Red Alert values from the EA source code. OpenRA balance available as an alternative preset. Selectable per-game in lobby.

**Rationale:**
- Original Red Alert's balance makes units feel **powerful and iconic** — Tanya, MiGs, Tesla Coils, V2 rockets are devastating. This is what made the game memorable.
- OpenRA rebalances toward competitive fairness, which can dilute the personality of iconic units. Valid for tournaments, wrong as a default.
- The community is split on this. Rather than picking a side, expose it as a choice.
- Presets are just alternate YAML files loaded at game start — zero engine complexity. The modding system already supports this via inheritance and overrides.
- The Remastered Collection made its own subtle balance tweaks — worth capturing as a third preset.

**Implementation:**
- `rules/presets/classic/` — unit/weapon/structure values from EA source code (default)
- `rules/presets/openra/` — values matching OpenRA's current balance
- `rules/presets/remastered/` — values matching the Remastered Collection
- Preset selection exposed in lobby UI and stored in game settings
- Presets use YAML inheritance: only override fields that differ from `classic`
- Multiplayer: all players must use the same preset (enforced by lobby, validated by sim)
- Custom presets: modders can create new presets as additional YAML directories

**What this is NOT:**
- Not a "difficulty setting" — both presets play at normal difficulty
- Not a mod — it's a first-class game option, no workshop download required
- Not just multiplayer — applies to skirmish and campaign too

**Alternatives considered:**
- Only ship classic values (rejected — alienates OpenRA competitive community)
- Only ship OpenRA values (rejected — loses the original game's personality)
- Let mods handle it (rejected — too important to bury in the modding system; should be one click in settings)

**Phase:** Phase 2 (balance values extracted during simulation implementation).

### D020 — Mod SDK & Creative Toolchain

**Decision:** Ship a Mod SDK comprising two components: (1) the `ic` CLI tool for headless mod workflow (init, check, test, build, publish), and (2) the **IC SDK application** — a visual creative toolchain with the scenario editor (D038), asset studio (D040), campaign editor, and Game Master mode. The SDK is a separate application from the game — players never see it (see D040 § SDK Architecture).

**Context:** The OpenRA Mod SDK is a template repository modders fork. It bundles shell scripts (`fetch-engine.sh`, `launch-game.sh`, `utility.sh`), a `Makefile`/`make.cmd` build system, and a `packaging/` directory with per-platform installer scripts. The approach works — it's the standard way to create OpenRA mods. But it has significant friction: requires .NET SDK, custom C# DLLs for anything beyond data changes, MiniYAML with no validation tooling, GPL contamination on mod code, and no distribution system beyond manual file sharing.

**What we adapt:**

| Concept            | OpenRA SDK                                         | Iron Curtain                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Starting point     | Fork a template repo                               | `ic mod init [template]` via `cargo-generate`    |
| Engine version pin | `ENGINE_VERSION` in `mod.config`                   | `engine.version` in `mod.yaml` with semver       |
| Engine management  | `fetch-engine.sh` downloads + compiles from source | Engine ships as binary crate, auto-resolved      |
| Build/run          | `Makefile` + shell scripts (requires Python, .NET) | `ic` CLI — single Rust binary, zero dependencies |
| Mod manifest       | `mod.yaml` in MiniYAML                             | `mod.yaml` in real YAML with typed serde schema  |
| Validation         | `utility.sh --check-yaml`                          | `ic mod check` — YAML + Lua + WASM validation    |
| Packaging          | `packaging/` shell scripts → .exe/.app/.AppImage   | `ic mod package` + workshop publish              |
| Dedicated server   | `launch-dedicated.sh`                              | `ic mod server`                                  |
| Directory layout   | Convention-based (chrome/, rules/, maps/, etc.)    | Adapted for three-tier model                     |
| IDE support        | `.vscode/` in repo                                 | VS Code extension with YAML schema + Lua LSP     |

**What we don't adapt (pain points we solve differently):**
- C# DLLs for custom traits → our Lua + WASM tiers are strictly better (no compilation, sandboxed, polyglot)
- GPL license contamination → WASM sandbox means mod code is isolated; engine license doesn't infect mods
- MiniYAML → real YAML with `serde_yaml`, JSON Schema, standard linters
- No hot-reload → Lua and YAML hot-reload during `ic mod watch`
- No workshop → built-in workshop with `ic mod publish`

**The `ic` CLI tool:**
A single Rust binary replacing OpenRA's shell scripts + Makefile + Python dependencies:

```
ic mod init [template]     # scaffold from template
ic mod check               # validate all mod content
ic mod test                # headless smoke test
ic mod run                 # launch game with mod
ic mod server              # dedicated server
ic mod package             # build distributables
ic mod publish             # workshop upload
ic mod watch               # hot-reload dev mode
ic mod lint                # convention + llm: metadata checks
ic mod update-engine       # bump engine version
ic sdk                     # launch the visual SDK application (scenario editor, asset studio, campaign editor)
ic sdk open [project]      # launch SDK with a specific mod/scenario
ic replay parse [file]     # extract replay data to structured output (JSON/CSV) — enables community stats sites,
                           #   tournament analysis, anti-cheat review (inspired by Valve's csgo-demoinfo)
ic replay inspect [file]   # summary view: players, map, duration, outcome, desync status
ic replay verify [file]    # verify relay signature chain + integrity (see 06-SECURITY.md)
```

> **CLI design principle (from Fossilize):** Each subcommand does one focused thing well — validate, convert, inspect, verify. Valve's Fossilize toolchain (`fossilize-replay`, `fossilize-merge`, `fossilize-convert`, `fossilize-list`) demonstrates that a family of small, composable CLI tools is more useful than a monolithic Swiss Army knife. The `ic` CLI follows this pattern: `ic mod check` validates, `ic mod convert` converts formats, `ic replay parse` extracts data, `ic replay inspect` summarizes. Each subcommand is independently useful and composable via shell pipelines. See `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 3.3 and § 6.2.

**Mod templates (built-in):**
- `data-mod` — YAML-only balance/cosmetic mods
- `scripted-mod` — missions and custom game modes (YAML + Lua)
- `total-conversion` — full layout with WASM scaffolding
- `map-pack` — map collections
- `asset-pack` — sprites, sounds, video packs

**Rationale:**
- OpenRA's SDK validates the template-project approach — modders want a turnkey starting point
- Engine version pinning is essential — mods break when engine updates; semver solves this cleanly
- A CLI tool is more portable, discoverable, and maintainable than shell scripts + Makefiles
- Workshop integration from the CLI closes the "last mile" — OpenRA modders must manually distribute their work
- The three-tier modding system means most modders never compile anything — `ic mod init data-mod` gives you a working mod instantly

**Alternatives considered:**
- Shell scripts like OpenRA (rejected — cross-platform pain, Python/shell dependencies, fragile)
- Cargo workspace (rejected — mods aren't Rust crates; YAML/Lua mods have nothing to compile)
- In-engine mod editor only (rejected — power users want filesystem access and version control)
- No SDK, just documentation (rejected — OpenRA proves that a template project dramatically lowers the barrier)

**Phase:** Phase 6a (Core Modding + Scenario Editor). CLI prototype in Phase 4 (for Lua scripting development).

### D021 — Branching Campaign System with Persistent State

**Decision:** Campaigns are directed graphs of missions with named outcomes, branching paths, persistent unit rosters, and continuous flow — not linear sequences with binary win/lose. Failure doesn't end the campaign; it branches to a different path. Unit state, equipment, and story flags persist across missions.

**Context:** OpenRA's campaigns are disconnected — each mission is standalone, you exit to menu after completion, there's no sense of flow or consequence. The original Red Alert had linear progression with FMV briefings but no branching or state persistence. Games like Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis showed that branching outcomes create dramatically more engaging campaigns, and OFP: Resistance proved that persistent unit rosters (surviving soldiers, captured equipment, accumulated experience) create deep emotional investment.

**Key design points:**

1. **Campaign graph:** Missions are nodes in a directed graph. Each mission has named outcomes (not just win/lose). Each outcome maps to a next-mission node, forming branches and convergences. The graph is defined in YAML and validated at load time.

2. **Named outcomes:** Lua scripts signal completion with a named key: `Campaign.complete("victory_bridge_intact")`. The campaign YAML maps each outcome to the next mission. This enables rich branching: "Won cleanly" → easy path, "Won with heavy losses" → harder path, "Failed" → fallback mission.

3. **Failure continues the game:** A `defeat` outcome is just another edge in the graph. The campaign designer decides what happens: retry with fewer resources, branch to a retreating mission, skip ahead with consequences, or even "no game over" campaigns where the story always continues.

4. **Persistent unit roster (OFP: Resistance model):**
   - Surviving units carry forward between missions (configurable per transition)
   - Units accumulate veterancy across missions — a veteran tank from mission 1 stays veteran in mission 5
   - Dead units are gone permanently — losing veterans hurts
   - Captured enemy equipment joins a persistent equipment pool
   - Five carryover modes: `none`, `surviving`, `extracted` (only units in evac zone), `selected` (Lua picks), `custom` (full Lua control)

5. **Story flags:** Arbitrary key-value state writable from Lua, readable in subsequent missions. Enables conditional content: "If the radar was captured in mission 2, it provides intel in mission 4."

6. **Campaign state is serializable:** Fits D010 (snapshottable sim state). Save games capture full campaign progress including roster, flags, and path taken. Replays can replay entire campaign runs.

7. **Continuous flow:** Briefing → mission → debrief → next mission. No exit to menu between levels unless the player explicitly quits.

8. **Campaign mission transitions:** When the sim ends and the next mission's assets need to load, the player never sees a blank screen or a generic loading bar. The transition sequence is: sim ends → debrief intermission displays (already loaded, zero wait) → background asset loading begins for the next mission → briefing intermission displays (runs concurrently with loading) → when loading completes and the player clicks "Begin Mission," gameplay starts instantly. If the player clicks before loading finishes, a non-intrusive progress indicator appears at the bottom of the briefing screen ("Preparing battlefield... 87%") — the briefing remains interactive, the player can re-read text or review the roster while waiting. For missions with cinematic intros (Video Playback module), the video plays while assets load in the background — by the time the cutscene ends, the mission is ready. This means campaign transitions feel like *narrative beats*, not technical interruptions. The only time a traditional loading screen appears is on first mission launch (cold start) or when asset size vastly exceeds available memory — and even then, the loading screen is themed to the campaign (campaign-defined background image, faction logo, loading tip text from `loading_tips.yaml`).

9. **Credits sequence:** The final campaign node can chain to a Credits intermission (see D038 § Intermission Screens). A credits sequence is defined per campaign — the RA1 game module ships with credits matching the original game's style (scrolling text over a background, Hell March playing). Modders define their own credits via the Credits intermission template or a `credits.yaml` file. Credits are skippable (press Escape or click) but play by default — respecting the work of everyone who contributed to the campaign.

10. **Narrative identity (Principle #20).** Briefings, debriefs, character dialogue, and mission framing follow the C&C narrative pillars: earnest commitment to the world, larger-than-life characters, quotable lines, and escalating stakes. Even procedurally generated campaigns (D016) are governed by the "C&C Classic" narrative DNA rules. See [13-PHILOSOPHY.md](13-PHILOSOPHY.md) § Principle 20 and D016 § "C&C Classic — Narrative DNA."

**Rationale:**
- OpenRA's disconnected missions are its single biggest single-player UX failure — universally cited in community feedback
- OFP proved persistent rosters create investment: players restart missions to save a veteran soldier
- Branching eliminates the frustration of replaying the same mission on failure — the campaign adapts
- YAML graph definition is accessible to modders (Tier 1) and LLM-generable
- Lua campaign API enables complex state logic while staying sandboxed
- The same system works for hand-crafted campaigns, modded campaigns, and LLM-generated campaigns

**Alternatives considered:**
- Linear mission sequence like RA1 (rejected — primitive, no replayability, failure is frustrating)
- Disconnected missions like OpenRA (rejected — the specific problem we're solving)
- Full open-world (rejected — scope too large, not appropriate for RTS)
- Only branching on win/lose (rejected — named outcomes are trivially more expressive with no added complexity)
- No unit persistence (rejected — OFP: Resistance proves this is the feature that creates campaign investment)

**Phase:** Phase 4 (AI & Single Player). Campaign graph engine and Lua Campaign API are core Phase 4 deliverables. The visual Campaign Editor in D038 (Phase 6b) builds on this system — D021 provides the sim-side engine, D038 provides the visual authoring tools.

### D022 — Dynamic Weather with Terrain Surface Effects

**Decision:** Weather transitions dynamically during gameplay via a deterministic state machine, and terrain textures visually respond to weather — snow accumulates on the ground, rain darkens/wets surfaces, sunshine dries them out. Terrain surface state optionally affects gameplay (movement penalties on snow/ice/mud).

**Context:** The base weather system (static per-mission, GPU particles + sim modifiers) provides atmosphere but doesn't evolve. Real-world weather changes. A mission that starts sunny and ends in a blizzard is vastly more dramatic — and strategically different — than one where weather is set-and-forget.

**Key design points:**

1. **Weather state machine (sim-side):** `WeatherState` resource tracks current type, intensity (fixed-point `0..1024`), and transition progress. Three schedule modes: `cycle` (deterministic round-robin), `random` (seeded from match, deterministic), `scripted` (Lua-driven only). State machine graph and transition weights defined in map YAML.

2. **Terrain surface state (sim-side):** `TerrainSurfaceGrid` — a per-cell grid of `SurfaceCondition { snow_depth, wetness }`. Updated every tick by `weather_surface_system`. Fully deterministic, derives `Serialize, Deserialize` for snapshots. When `sim_effects: true`, surface state modifies movement: deep snow slows infantry/vehicles, ice makes water passable, mud bogs wheeled units.

3. **Terrain texture effects (render-side):** Three quality tiers — palette tinting (free, no assets needed), overlay sprites (moderate, one extra pass), shader blending (GPU blend between base + weather variant textures). Selectable via `RenderSettings`. Accumulation is gradual and spatially non-uniform (snow appears on edges/roofs first, puddles in low cells first).

4. **Composes with day/night and seasons:** Overcast days are darker, rain at night is near-black with lightning flashes. Map `temperature.base` controls whether precipitation is rain or snow. Arctic/desert/tropical maps set different defaults.

5. **Fully moddable:** YAML defines schedules and surface rates (Tier 1). Lua triggers transitions and queries surface state (Tier 2). WASM adds custom weather types like ion storms (Tier 3).

**Rationale:**
- No other C&C engine has dynamic weather that affects terrain visuals — unique differentiator
- Deterministic state machine preserves lockstep (same seed = same weather progression on all clients)
- Sim/render split respected: surface state is sim (deterministic), visual blending is render (cosmetic)
- Palette tinting tier ensures even low-end devices and WASM can show weather effects
- Gameplay effects are optional per-map — purely cosmetic weather is valid
- Surface state fits the snapshot system (D010) for save games and replays
- Weather schedules are LLM-generable — "generate a mission where weather gets progressively worse"

**Performance:**
- Palette tinting: zero extra draw calls, negligible GPU cost
- Surface state grid: ~2 bytes per cell (compact fixed-point) — a 128×128 map is 32KB
- `weather_surface_system` is O(cells) but amortized via spatial quadrant rotation: the map is partitioned into 4 quadrants and one quadrant is updated per tick, achieving 4× throughput with constant 1-tick latency. This is a sim-only strategy — it does not depend on camera position (the sim has no camera awareness).
- Follows efficiency pyramid: algorithmic (grid lookup) → cache-friendly (contiguous array) → amortized

**Alternatives considered:**
- Static weather only (rejected — misses dramatic potential, no terrain response)
- Client-side random weather (rejected — breaks deterministic sim, desync risk)
- Full volumetric weather simulation (rejected — overkill, performance cost, not needed for isometric RTS)
- Always-on sim effects (rejected — weather-as-decoration is valid for casual/modded games)

**Phase:** Phase 3 (visual effects) for render-side; Phase 2 (sim implementation) for weather state machine and surface grid.

---

### D023 — OpenRA Vocabulary Compatibility Layer

**Decision:** Accept OpenRA trait names and YAML keys as aliases in our YAML parser. Both OpenRA-style names (e.g., `Armament`, `Valued`, `Buildable`) and IC-native names (e.g., `combat`, `buildable.cost`) resolve to the same ECS components. Unconverted OpenRA YAML loads with a deprecation warning.

**Context:** The biggest migration barrier for the 80% YAML tier isn't missing features — it's naming divergence. Every renamed concept multiplies across thousands of mod files. OpenRA modders have years of muscle memory with trait names and YAML keys. Forcing renames creates friction that discourages adoption.

**Key design points:**

1. **Alias registry:** `ra-formats` maintains a compile-time map of OpenRA trait names to IC component names. `Armament` → `combat`, `Valued` → `buildable.cost`, `AttackOmni` → `combat.mode: omni`, etc.
2. **Bi-directional:** The alias registry is used during YAML parsing (OpenRA names accepted) and by the `miniyaml2yaml` converter (produces IC-native names). Both representations are valid.
3. **Deprecation warnings:** When an OpenRA alias is used, the parser emits a warning: `"Armament" is accepted but deprecated; prefer "combat"`. Warnings can be suppressed per-mod via `mod.yaml` setting.
4. **No runtime cost:** Aliases resolve during YAML deserialization (load time only). The ECS never sees alias names — only canonical IC component types.

**Rationale:**
- Reduces the YAML migration from "convert everything" to "drop in and play, clean up later"
- Respects invariant #8 ("the community's existing work is sacred") at the data vocabulary layer, not just binary formats
- Zero runtime cost — purely a deserialization convenience
- Makes `miniyaml2yaml` output immediately usable even without manual cleanup
- Modders can learn IC-native names gradually as they edit files

**Alternatives considered:**
- IC-native names only (rejected — unnecessary migration barrier for thousands of existing mod files)
- Adopt OpenRA's names wholesale (rejected — some OpenRA names are poorly chosen or C#-specific; IC benefits from cleaner naming)
- Converter handles everything (rejected — modders still need to re-learn names for new content; aliases let them use familiar names forever)

**Phase:** Phase 0 (alias registry built alongside `ra-formats` YAML parser). Phase 6a (deprecation warnings configurable in `mod.yaml`).

---

### D024 — Lua API Superset of OpenRA

**Decision:** Iron Curtain's Lua scripting API is a strict superset of OpenRA's 16 global objects. Same function names, same parameter signatures, same return types. OpenRA Lua missions run unmodified. IC then extends with additional functionality.

**Context:** OpenRA has a mature Lua API used in hundreds of campaign missions across all C&C game mods. Combined Arms alone has 34 Lua-scripted missions. The mod migration doc (12-MOD-MIGRATION.md) identified "API compatibility shim" as a migration requirement — this decision elevates it from "nice to have" to "hard requirement."

**OpenRA's 16 globals (all must work identically in IC):**

| Global           | Purpose                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `Actor`          | Create, query, manipulate actors   |
| `Map`            | Terrain, bounds, spatial queries   |
| `Trigger`        | Event hooks (OnKilled, AfterDelay) |
| `Media`          | Audio, video, text display         |
| `Player`         | Player state, resources, diplomacy |
| `Reinforcements` | Spawn units at edges/drops         |
| `Camera`         | Pan, position, shake               |
| `DateTime`       | Game time queries                  |
| `Objectives`     | Mission objective management       |
| `Lighting`       | Global lighting control            |
| `UserInterface`  | UI text, notifications             |
| `Utils`          | Math, random, table utilities      |
| `Beacon`         | Map beacon management              |
| `Radar`          | Radar ping control                 |
| `HSLColor`       | Color construction                 |
| `WDist`          | Distance unit conversion           |

**IC extensions (additions, not replacements):**

| Global      | Purpose                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Campaign`  | Branching campaign state (D021)      |
| `Weather`   | Dynamic weather control (D022)       |
| `Layer`     | Runtime layer activation/deaction    |
| `Region`    | Named region queries                 |
| `Var`       | Mission/campaign variable access     |
| `Workshop`  | Mod metadata queries                 |
| `LLM`       | LLM integration hooks (Phase 7)      |
| `Commands`  | Command registration for mods (D058) |
| `Ping`      | Typed tactical pings (D059)          |
| `ChatWheel` | Auto-translated phrase system (D059) |
| `Marker`    | Persistent tactical markers (D059)   |
| `Chat`      | Programmatic chat messages (D059)    |

**Actor properties also match:** Each actor reference exposes properties matching OpenRA's property groups (`.Health`, `.Location`, `.Owner`, `.Move()`, `.Attack()`, `.Stop()`, `.Guard()`, `.Deploy()`, etc.) with identical semantics.

**Rationale:**
- CA's 34 missions + hundreds of community missions work on day one — no porting effort
- Reduces Lua migration from "moderate effort" to "zero effort" for standard missions
- IC's extensions are additive — no conflicts, no breaking changes
- Modders who know OpenRA Lua immediately know IC Lua
- Future OpenRA missions created by the community are automatically IC-compatible

**Alternatives considered:**
- Design our own API, provide shim (rejected — shim is always leaky, creates two mental models)
- Partial compatibility (rejected — partial breaks are worse than full breaks; either missions work or they don't)
- No Lua compatibility (rejected — throws away hundreds of community missions for no gain)

**Phase:** Phase 4 (Lua scripting implementation). API surface documented during Phase 2 planning.

---

### D025 — Runtime MiniYAML Loading

**Decision:** Support loading MiniYAML directly at runtime as a fallback format in `ra-formats`. When the engine encounters tab-indented files with `^` inheritance or `@` suffixes, it auto-converts in memory. The `miniyaml2yaml` CLI converter still exists for permanent migration, but is no longer a prerequisite for loading mods.

**Revision of D003:** D003 ("Real YAML, not MiniYAML") remains the canonical format. All IC-native content uses standard YAML. D025 adds a compatibility loader — it does not change what IC produces, only what it accepts.

**Key design points:**

1. **Format detection:** `ra-formats` checks the first few lines of each file. Tab-indented content with no YAML indicators triggers the MiniYAML parser path.
2. **In-memory conversion:** MiniYAML is parsed to an intermediate tree, then resolved to standard YAML structs. The result is identical to what `miniyaml2yaml` would produce.
3. **Combined with D023:** OpenRA trait name aliases (D023) apply after MiniYAML parsing — so the full chain is: MiniYAML → intermediate tree → alias resolution → typed Rust structs.
4. **Performance:** Conversion adds ~10-50ms per mod at load time (one-time cost). Cached after first load.
5. **Warning output:** Console logs `"Loaded MiniYAML file rules.yaml — consider converting to standard YAML with 'ic mod convert'"`.

**Rationale:**
- Turns "migrate then play" into "play immediately, migrate when ready"
- Existing OpenRA mods become testable on IC within minutes, not hours
- Respects invariant #8 — the community's existing work is sacred, including their file formats
- The converter CLI still exists for modders who want clean IC-native files
- No performance impact after initial load (conversion result is cached)

**Alternatives considered:**
- Require pre-conversion (original plan — rejected as unnecessary friction; the converter runs in memory just as well as on disk)
- Support MiniYAML as a first-class format permanently (rejected — standard YAML is strictly better for tooling, validation, and editor support)
- Only support converted files (rejected — blocks quick experimentation and casual mod testing)

**Phase:** Phase 0 (MiniYAML parser already needed for `miniyaml2yaml`; making it a runtime loader is minimal additional work).

---

### D026 — OpenRA Mod Manifest Compatibility

**Decision:** `ra-formats` can parse OpenRA's `mod.yaml` manifest format and auto-map it to IC's mod structure at load time. Combined with D023 (aliases), D024 (Lua API), and D025 (MiniYAML loading), this means a modder can point IC at an existing OpenRA mod directory and it loads — no restructuring needed.

**Key design points:**

1. **Manifest parsing:** OpenRA's `mod.yaml` declares `Packages`, `Rules`, `Sequences`, `Cursors`, `Chrome`, `Assemblies`, `ChromeLayout`, `Weapons`, `Voices`, `Notifications`, `Music`, `Translations`, `MapFolders`, `SoundFormats`, `SpriteFormats`. IC maps each section to its equivalent concept.
2. **Directory convention mapping:** OpenRA mods use `rules/`, `maps/`, `sequences/` etc. IC maps these to its own layout at load time without copying files.
3. **Unsupported sections flagged:** `Assemblies` (C# DLLs) cannot load — these are flagged as warnings listing which custom traits are unavailable and what WASM alternatives exist.
4. **Partial loading:** A mod with unsupported C# traits still loads — units using those traits get a visual placeholder and a "missing trait" debug overlay. The mod is playable with reduced functionality.
5. **`ic mod import`:** CLI command that reads an OpenRA mod directory and generates an IC-native `mod.yaml` with proper structure, converting files to standard YAML and flagging C# dependencies for WASM migration.

**Rationale:**
- Combined with D023/D024/D025, this completes the "zero-friction import" pipeline
- Modders can evaluate IC as a target without committing to migration
- Partial loading means even mods with C# dependencies are partially testable
- The `ic mod import` command provides a clean migration path when the modder is ready
- Validates our claim that "the community's existing work is sacred"

**Alternatives considered:**
- Require manual mod restructuring (rejected — unnecessary friction, blocks adoption)
- Only support IC mod format (rejected — makes evaluation impossible without migration effort)
- Full C# trait loading via .NET interop (rejected — violates D001/D002, reintroduces the problems Rust solves)

**Phase:** Phase 0 (manifest parsing) + Phase 6a (full `ic mod import` workflow).

---

### D027 — Canonical Enum Compatibility with OpenRA

**Decision:** Use OpenRA's canonical enum names for locomotor types, armor types, target types, damage states, and other enumerated values — or accept both OpenRA and IC-native names via the alias system (D023).

**Specific enums aligned:**

| Enum Type    | OpenRA Names                                                | IC Accepts       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Locomotor    | `Foot`, `Wheeled`, `Tracked`, `Float`, `Fly`                | Same (canonical) |
| Armor        | `None`, `Light`, `Medium`, `Heavy`, `Wood`, `Concrete`      | Same (canonical) |
| Target Type  | `Ground`, `Air`, `Water`, `Underground`                     | Same (canonical) |
| Damage State | `Undamaged`, `Light`, `Medium`, `Heavy`, `Critical`, `Dead` | Same (canonical) |
| Stance       | `AttackAnything`, `Defend`, `ReturnFire`, `HoldFire`        | Same (canonical) |
| UnitType     | `Building`, `Infantry`, `Vehicle`, `Aircraft`, `Ship`       | Same (canonical) |

**Why this matters:** The `Versus` damage table — which modders spend 80% of their balance time tuning — uses armor type names as keys. Locomotor types determine pathfinding behavior. Target types control weapon targeting. If these don't match, every single weapon definition, armor table, and locomotor reference needs translation. By matching names, these definitions copy-paste directly.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates an entire category of conversion mapping
- Versus tables, weapon definitions, locomotor configs — all transfer without renaming
- OpenRA's names are reasonable and well-known in the community
- No technical reason to rename these — they describe the same concepts
- Where IC needs additional values (e.g., `Hover`, `Amphibious`), they extend the enum without conflicting

**Phase:** Phase 2 (when enum types are formally defined in `ic-sim`).

---

### D028 — Condition and Multiplier Systems as Phase 2 Requirements

**Decision:** The condition system and multiplier system identified as P0 critical gaps in `11-OPENRA-FEATURES.md` are promoted to hard Phase 2 exit criteria. Phase 2 cannot ship without both systems implemented and tested.

**What this adds to Phase 2:**

1. **Condition system:**
   - `Conditions` component: `HashMap<ConditionId, u32>` (ref-counted named conditions per entity)
   - Condition sources: `GrantConditionOnMovement`, `GrantConditionOnDamageState`, `GrantConditionOnDeploy`, `GrantConditionOnAttack`, `GrantConditionOnTerrain`, `GrantConditionOnVeterancy` — exposed in YAML
   - Condition consumers: any component field can declare `requires:` or `disabled_by:` conditions
   - Runtime: systems check `conditions.is_active("deployed")` via fast bitset or hash lookup

2. **Multiplier system:**
   - `StatModifiers` component: per-entity stack of `(source, stat, modifier_value, condition)`
   - Every numeric stat (speed, damage, range, reload, build time, build cost, sight range, etc.) resolves through the modifier stack
   - Modifiers from: veterancy, terrain, crates, conditions, player handicaps
   - Fixed-point multiplication (no floats)
   - YAML-configurable: modders add multipliers without code

3. **Full damage pipeline:**
   - Armament → Projectile entity → travel → impact → Warhead(s) → armor-versus-weapon table → DamageMultiplier resolution → Health reduction
   - Composable warheads: each weapon can trigger multiple warheads (damage + condition + terrain effect)

**Rationale:**
- Without conditions, 80% of OpenRA YAML mods cannot express their behavior at all — conditions are the fundamental modding primitive
- Without multipliers, veterancy/crates/terrain bonuses don't work — critical gameplay systems are broken
- Without the full damage pipeline, weapons are simplistic and balance modding is impossible
- These three systems are the foundation that P1–P3 features build on (stealth, veterancy, transport, support powers all use conditions and multipliers)
- Promoting from "identified gap" to "exit criteria" ensures they're not deferred

**Phase:** Phase 2 (hard exit criteria — no Phase 3 starts without these).

---

### D029 — Cross-Game Component Library (Phase 2 Targets)

**Decision:** The seven first-party component systems identified in `12-MOD-MIGRATION.md` (from Combined Arms and Remastered case studies) are Phase 2 targets. They are high priority and independently scoped — any that don't land by Phase 2 exit are early Phase 3 work, not deferred indefinitely. (The D028 systems — conditions, multipliers, damage pipeline — are the hard Phase 2 gate; see `08-ROADMAP.md` § Phase 2 exit criteria.)

**The seven systems:**

| System                   | Needed For                                  | Phase 2 Scope                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Delayed Weapons**      | CA (radiation, poison), RA2 (terror drones) | Timer-attached effects on targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Dual Asset Rendering** | Remastered recreation, HD mod packs         | Superseded by the Resource Pack system (`04-MODDING.md` § "Resource Packs") which generalizes this to N asset tiers, not just two. Phase 2 scope: `ic-render` supports runtime-switchable asset source per entity; Resource Pack manifests resolve at load time. |

**Evidence from OpenRA mod ecosystem:** Analysis of six major OpenRA community mods (see `research/openra-mod-architecture-analysis.md` and `research/openra-ra2-mod-architecture.md`) validates and extends this list. Cross-game component reuse is the most consistent pattern across mods — the same mechanics appear independently in 3–5 mods each:

| Component          | Mods Using It           | Notes                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mind Control       | RA2, Romanovs-Vengeance | MindController/MindControllable with capacity limits, DiscardOldest policy, ArcLaserZap visual        |
| Carrier/Spawner    | RA2, OpenHV, OpenSA     | BaseSpawnerParent→CarrierParent hierarchy; OpenHV uses for drone carriers; OpenSA for colony spawning |
| Infection          | RA2, Romanovs-Vengeance | InfectableInfo with damage/kill triggers                                                              |
| Disguise/Mirage    | RA2, Romanovs-Vengeance | MirageInfo with configurable reveal triggers (attack, damage, deploy, unload, infiltrate, heal)       |
| Temporal Weapons   | RA2, Romanovs-Vengeance | ChronoVortexInfo with return-to-start mechanics                                                       |
| Radiation          | RA2                     | World-level TintedCellsLayer with sparse storage and logarithmic decay                                |
| Hacking            | OpenHV                  | HackerInfo with delay, condition grant on target                                                      |
| Periodic Discharge | OpenHV                  | PeriodicDischargeInfo with damage/effects on timer                                                    |
| Colony Capture     | OpenSA                  | ColonyBit with conversion mechanics                                                                   |

This validates that IC's seven systems are necessary but reveals two additional patterns that appear cross-game: **infection** (delayed damage/conversion — distinct from "delayed weapons" in that the infected unit carries the effect) and **disguise/mirage** (appearance substitution with configurable reveal triggers). These are candidates for promotion from WASM-only to first-party components.

**Rationale:**
- These aren't CA-specific — they're needed for RA2 (the likely second game module). Building them in Phase 2 means they're available when RA2 development starts.
- CA can migrate to IC the moment the engine is playable, rather than waiting for Phase 6a
- Without these as built-in components, CA modders would need to write WASM for basic mechanics like mind control — unacceptable for adoption
- The seven systems cover ~60% of CA's custom C# code — collapsing the WASM tier from ~15% to ~5% of migration effort
- Each system is independently useful and well-scoped (2-5 days engineering each)

**Impact on migration estimates:**

| Migration Tier | Before D029 | After D029 |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Tier 1 (YAML)  | ~40%        | ~45%       |
| Built-in       | ~30%        | ~40%       |
| Tier 2 (Lua)   | ~15%        | ~10%       |
| Tier 3 (WASM)  | ~15%        | ~5%        |

**Phase:** Phase 2 (sim-side components and dual asset rendering in `ic-render`).

## D030: Workshop Resource Registry & Dependency System

**Decision:** The Workshop operates as a crates.io-style resource registry where any game asset — music, sprites, textures, cutscenes, maps, sound effects, palettes, voice lines, UI themes, templates — is publishable as an independent, versioned, licensable resource that others (including LLM agents, with author consent) can discover, depend on, and pull automatically. Authors control AI access to their resources separately from the license via `ai_usage` permissions.

**Rationale:**
- OpenRA has no resource sharing infrastructure — modders copy-paste files, share on forums, lose attribution
- Individual resources (a single music track, one sprite sheet) should be as easy to publish and consume as full mods
- A dependency system eliminates duplication: five mods that need the same HD sprite pack declare it as a dependency instead of each bundling 200MB of sprites
- License metadata protects community creators and enables automated compatibility checking
- LLM agents generating missions need a way to discover and pull community assets without human intervention
- The mod ecosystem grows faster when building blocks are reusable — this is why npm/crates.io/pip changed their respective ecosystems
- CI/CD-friendly publishing (headless CLI, scoped API tokens) lets serious mod teams automate their release pipeline — no manual uploads

**Key Design Elements:**

### Phased Delivery Strategy

The Workshop design below is comprehensive, but it ships incrementally:

| Phase     | Scope                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Complexity   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Phase 0–3 | **Git-hosted index:** `workshop-index` GitHub repo as package registry (`index.yaml` + per-package manifests). `.icpkg` files stored on GitHub Releases (free CDN). Community contributes via PR. `git-index` source type in Workshop client. Zero infrastructure cost | Minimal      |
| Phase 3–4 | **Add P2P:** BitTorrent tracker ($5-10/month VPS). Package manifests gain `torrent` source entries. P2P delivery for large packages. Git index remains discovery layer. Format recommendations published                                                               | Low–Medium   |
| Phase 4–5 | **Minimal viable Workshop:** Full Workshop server (search, ratings, deps) + integrated P2P tracker + `ic mod publish` + `ic mod install` + in-game browser + auto-download on lobby join                                                                               | Medium       |
| Phase 6a  | **Full Workshop:** Federation, community servers join P2P swarm, replication, promotion channels, CI/CD token scoping, creator reputation, DMCA process, Steam Workshop as optional source                                                                             | High         |
| Phase 7+  | **Advanced:** LLM-driven discovery, premium hosting tiers                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Low priority |

The Artifactory-level federation design is the end state, not the MVP. Ship simple, iterate toward complex. P2P delivery (D049) is integrated from Phase 3–4 because centralized hosting costs are a sustainability risk — better to solve early than retrofit. Workshop packages use the `.icpkg` format (ZIP with `manifest.yaml`) — see D049 for full specification.

**Cross-engine validation:** O3DE's **Gem system** uses a declarative `gem.json` manifest with explicit dependency declarations, version constraints, and categorized tags — the same structure IC targets for Workshop packages. O3DE's template system (`o3de register --template-path`) scaffolds new projects from standard templates, validating IC's planned `ic mod init --template=...` CLI command. Factorio's mod portal uses semver dependency ranges (e.g., `>= 1.1.0`) with automatic resolution — the same model IC should use for Workshop package dependencies. See `research/godot-o3de-engine-analysis.md` § O3DE and `research/mojang-wube-modding-analysis.md` § Factorio.

### Resource Identity & Versioning

Every Workshop resource gets a globally unique identifier: `publisher/name@version`.

- **Publisher** = author username or organization (e.g., `alice`, `community-hd-project`)
- **Name** = resource name, lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `soviet-march-music`, `allied-infantry-hd`)
- **Version** = semver (e.g., `1.2.0`)
- Full ID example: `alice/soviet-march-music@1.2.0`

### Resource Categories (Expanded)

Resources aren't limited to mod-sized packages. Granularity is flexible:

| Category           | Granularity Examples                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Music              | Single track, album, soundtrack                                                                                                                             |
| Sound Effects      | Weapon sound pack, ambient loops, UI sounds                                                                                                                 |

A published resource is just a `ResourcePackage` with the appropriate `ResourceCategory`. The existing `asset-pack` template and `ic mod publish` flow handle this natively — no separate command needed.

### Dependency Declaration

`mod.yaml` already has a `dependencies:` section. D030 formalizes the resolution semantics:

```yaml
# mod.yaml
dependencies:
  - id: "community-project/hd-infantry-sprites"
    version: "^2.0"                    # semver range (cargo-style)
    source: workshop                   # workshop | local | url
  - id: "alice/soviet-march-music"
    version: ">=1.0, <3.0"
    source: workshop
    optional: true                     # soft dependency — mod works without it
  - id: "bob/desert-terrain-textures"
    version: "~1.4"                    # compatible with 1.4.x
    source: workshop
```

Resource packages can also declare dependencies on other resources (transitive):

```yaml
# A mission pack depends on a sprite pack and a music track
dependencies:
  - id: "community-project/hd-sprites"
    version: "^2.0"
    source: workshop
  - id: "alice/briefing-videos"
    version: "^1.0"
    source: workshop
```

### Repository Types

The Workshop uses three repository types (architecture inspired by Artifactory's local/remote/virtual model):

| Source Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local**   | A directory on disk following Workshop structure. Stores resources you create. Used for development, LAN parties, offline play, pre-publish testing.                                                                                                              |
| **Remote**  | A Workshop server (official or community-hosted). Resources are downloaded and cached locally on first access. Cache is used for subsequent requests — works offline after first pull.                                                                            |
| **Virtual** | The aggregated view across all configured sources. The `ic` CLI and in-game browser query the virtual view — it merges listings from all local + remote + git-index sources, deduplicates by resource ID, and resolves version conflicts using priority ordering. |

The `settings.yaml` `sources:` list defines which local and remote sources compose the virtual view. This is the federation model — the client never queries raw servers directly, it queries the merged Workshop view.

### Package Integrity

Every published resource includes cryptographic checksums for integrity verification:

- **SHA-256 checksum** stored in the package manifest and on the Workshop server
- `ic mod install` verifies checksums after download — mismatch → abort + warning
- `ic.lock` records both version AND checksum for each dependency — guarantees byte-identical installs across machines
- Protects against: corrupted downloads, CDN tampering, mirror drift
- Workshop server computes checksums on upload; clients verify on download. Trust but verify.

### Manifest Integrity & Confusion Prevention

The canonical package manifest is **inside the `.icpkg` archive** (`manifest.yaml`). The git-index entry and Workshop server metadata are derived summaries — never independent sources of truth. See `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 20 for the full threat analysis (inspired by the 2023 npm manifest confusion affecting 800+ packages).

- **`manifest_hash` field:** Every index entry includes `manifest_hash: SHA-256(manifest.yaml)` — the hash of the manifest file itself, separate from the full-package hash. Clients verify this independently.
- **CI validation (git-index phase):** PR validation CI downloads the `.icpkg`, extracts `manifest.yaml`, computes its hash, and verifies against the declared `manifest_hash`. Mismatch → PR rejected.
- **Client verification:** `ic mod install` verifies the extracted `manifest.yaml` matches the index's `manifest_hash` before processing mod content. Mismatch → abort.

### Version Immutability

Once version X.Y.Z is published, its content **cannot** be modified or overwritten. The SHA-256 hash recorded at publish time is permanent.

- **Yanking ≠ deletion:** Yanked versions are hidden from new `ic mod install` searches but remain downloadable for existing `ic.lock` files that reference them.
- **Git-index enforcement:** CI rejects PRs that modify fields in existing version manifest files. Only additions of new version files are accepted.
- **Registry enforcement (Phase 4+):** Workshop server API rejects publish requests for existing version numbers with HTTP 409 Conflict. No override flag.

### Typosquat & Name Confusion Prevention

Publisher-scoped naming (`publisher/package`) is the structural defense — see `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 19. Additional measures:

- **Name similarity checking at publish time:** Levenshtein distance + common substitution patterns checked against existing packages. Edit distance ≤ 2 from an existing popular package → flagged for manual review.
- **Disambiguation in mod manager:** When multiple similar names exist, the search UI shows a notice with download counts and publisher reputation.

### Reputation System Integrity

The Workshop reputation system (download count, average rating, dependency count, publish consistency, community reports) includes anti-gaming measures:

- **Rate-limited reviews:** One review per account per package. Accounts must be >7 days old with at least one game session to leave reviews.
- **Download deduplication:** Counts unique authenticated users, not raw download events. Anonymous downloads deduplicated by IP with a time window.
- **Sockpuppet detection:** Burst of positive reviews from newly created accounts → flagged for moderator review. Review weight is proportional to reviewer account age and activity.
- **Source repo verification (optional):** If a package links to a source repository, the publisher can verify push access to earn a "verified source" badge.

### Abandoned Package Policy

A published package is considered **abandoned** after 18+ months of inactivity AND no response to 3 maintainer contact attempts over 90 days.

- **Archive-first default:** Abandoned packages are archived (still installable, marked "unmaintained" with a banner) rather than transferred.
- **Transfer process:** Community can nominate a new maintainer. Requires moderator approval + 30-day public notice period. Original author can reclaim within 6 months.
- **Published version immutability survives transfer.** New maintainer can publish new versions but cannot modify existing ones.

### Promotion & Maturity Channels

Resources can be published to maturity channels, allowing staged releases:

| Channel   | Purpose                         | Visibility                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `dev`     | Work-in-progress, local testing | Author only (local repos only)  |
| `beta`    | Pre-release, community testing  | Opt-in (users enable beta flag) |
| `release` | Stable, production-ready        | Default (everyone sees these)   |

```yaml
# mod.yaml
mod:
  version: "1.3.0-beta.1"            # semver pre-release tag
  channel: beta                       # publish to beta channel
```

- `ic mod publish --channel beta` → visible only to users who opt in to beta resources
- `ic mod publish` (no flag) → release channel by default
- `ic mod install` pulls from release channel unless `--include-beta` is specified
- Promotion: `ic mod promote 1.3.0-beta.1 release` → moves resource to release channel without re-upload

### Replication & Mirroring

Community Workshop servers can replicate from the official server (pull replication, Artifactory-style):

- **Pull replication:** Community server periodically syncs popular resources from official. Reduces latency for regional players, provides redundancy.
- **Selective sync:** Community servers choose which categories/publishers to replicate (e.g., replicate all Maps but not Mods)
- **Offline bundles:** `ic workshop export-bundle` creates a portable archive of selected resources for LAN parties or airgapped environments. `ic workshop import-bundle` loads them into a local repository.

### Dependency Resolution

Cargo-inspired version solving:

- **Semver ranges:** `^1.2` (>=1.2.0, <2.0.0), `~1.2` (>=1.2.0, <1.3.0), `>=1.0, <3.0`, exact `=1.2.3`
- **Lockfile:** `ic.lock` records exact resolved versions + SHA-256 checksums for reproducible installs. In multi-source configurations, also records the **source identifier** per dependency (`source:publisher/package@version`) to prevent dependency confusion across federated sources (see `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 22).
- **Transitive resolution:** If mod A depends on resource B which depends on resource C, all three are resolved
- **Conflict detection:** Two dependencies requiring incompatible versions of the same resource → error with resolution suggestions
- **Deduplication:** Same resource pulled by multiple dependents is stored once in local cache
- **Offline resolution:** Once cached, all dependencies resolve from local cache — no network required

### CLI Extensions

```
ic mod resolve         # compute dependency graph, report conflicts
ic mod install         # download all dependencies to local cache
ic mod update          # update deps to latest compatible versions (respects semver)
ic mod tree            # display dependency tree (like `cargo tree`)
ic mod lock            # regenerate ic.lock from current mod.yaml
ic mod audit           # check dependency licenses for compatibility + source confusion detection
ic mod list             # list all local resources (state, size, last used, source)
ic mod remove <pkg>     # remove resource from disk (dependency-aware, prompts for cascade)
ic mod deactivate <pkg> # keep on disk but don't load (quick toggle without re-download)
ic mod activate <pkg>   # re-enable a deactivated resource
ic mod pin <pkg>        # mark as "keep" — exempt from auto-cleanup
ic mod unpin <pkg>      # allow auto-cleanup (returns to transient state)
ic mod clean            # remove all expired transient resources
ic mod clean --dry-run  # show what would be cleaned without removing anything
ic mod status           # disk usage summary: total, by category, by state, largest resources
```

These extend the existing `ic` CLI (D020), not replace it. `ic mod publish` already exists — it now also uploads dependency metadata and validates license presence.

### Local Resource Management

Without active management, a player's disk fills with resources from lobby auto-downloads, one-off map packs, and abandoned mods. IC treats this as a first-class design problem — not an afterthought.

**Resource lifecycle states:**

Every local resource is in exactly one of these states:

| State           | On disk? | Loaded by game? | Auto-cleanup eligible?                  | How to enter                                                                |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pinned**      | Yes      | Yes             | No — stays until explicitly removed     | `ic mod install`, "Install" in Workshop UI, `ic mod pin`, or auto-promotion |
| **Transient**   | Yes      | Yes             | Yes — after TTL expires                 | Lobby auto-download, transitive dependency of a transient resource          |
| **Deactivated** | Yes      | No              | No — explicit state, player decides     | `ic mod deactivate` or toggle in UI                                         |
| **Expiring**    | Yes      | Yes             | Yes — in grace period, deletion pending | Transient resource unused for `transient_ttl_days`                          |
| **Removed**     | No       | No              | N/A                                     | `ic mod remove`, auto-cleanup, or player confirmation                       |

**Pinned vs. Transient — the core distinction:**

- **Pinned** resources are things the player explicitly chose: they clicked "Install," ran `ic mod install`, or marked a resource as "Keep." Pinned resources stay on disk forever until the player explicitly removes them. This is the default state for deliberate installations.
- **Transient** resources arrived automatically — lobby auto-downloads, dependencies pulled transitively by other transient resources. They're fully functional (loaded, playable, seedable) but have a time-to-live. After `transient_ttl_days` without being used in a game session (default: 30 days), they enter the **Expiring** state.

This distinction means a player who joins a modded lobby once doesn't accumulate permanent disk debt. The resources work for that session and stick around for a month in case the player returns to similar lobbies — then quietly clean up.

**Auto-promotion:** If a transient resource is used in 3+ separate game sessions, it's automatically promoted to Pinned. A non-intrusive notification tells the player: "Kept alice/hd-sprites — you've used it in 5 matches." This preserves content the player clearly enjoys without requiring manual action.

**Deactivation:**

Deactivated resources stay on disk but aren't loaded by the game. Use cases:
- Temporarily disable a heavy mod without losing it (and having to re-download 500 MB later)
- Keep content available for quick re-activation (one click, no network)
- Deactivated resources are still available as P2P seeds (configurable via `seed_deactivated` setting) since they're already integrity-verified

Dependency-aware: deactivating a resource that others depend on offers: "bob/tank-skins depends on this. Deactivate both? [Both / Just this one / Cancel]". Deactivating "just this one" means dependents that reference it will show a missing-dependency warning in the mod manager.

**Dependency-aware removal:**

`ic mod remove alice/hd-sprites` checks the reverse dependency graph:
- If nothing depends on it → remove immediately.
- If bob/tank-skins depends on it → prompt: "bob/tank-skins depends on alice/hd-sprites. Remove both? [Yes / No / Remove only alice/hd-sprites and deactivate bob/tank-skins]"
- `ic mod remove alice/hd-sprites --cascade` → removes the resource and all resources that become orphaned as a result (no explicit dependents left).
- Orphan detection: after any removal, scan for resources with zero dependents and zero explicit install (not pinned by the player). These are cleanup candidates.

**Storage budget and auto-cleanup:**

```yaml
# settings.yaml
workshop:
  cache_dir: "~/.ic/cache"
  storage:
    budget_gb: 10                   # max transient cache before auto-cleanup (0 = unlimited)
    transient_ttl_days: 30          # days of non-use before transient resources expire
    cleanup_prompt: "weekly"        # never | after-session | weekly | monthly
    low_disk_warning_gb: 5          # warn when OS free space drops below this
    seed_deactivated: false         # P2P seed deactivated (but verified) resources
```

- `budget_gb` applies to **transient** resources only. Pinned and deactivated resources don't count against the auto-cleanup budget (but are shown in disk usage summaries).
- When transient cache exceeds `budget_gb`, the oldest (by last-used timestamp) transient resources are cleaned first — LRU eviction.
- At 80% of budget, the content manager shows a gentle notice: "Workshop cache is 8.1 / 10 GB. [Clean up now] [Adjust budget]"
- On low system disk space (below `low_disk_warning_gb`), cleanup suggestions become more prominent and include deactivated resources as candidates.

**Post-session cleanup prompt:**

After a game session that auto-downloaded resources, a non-intrusive toast appears:

```
 Downloaded 2 new resources for this match (47 MB).
  alice/hd-sprites@2.0    38 MB
  bob/desert-map@1.1       9 MB
 [Pin (keep forever)]  [They'll auto-clean in 30 days]  [Remove now]
```

The default (clicking away or ignoring the toast) is "transient" — resources stay for 30 days then auto-clean. The player only needs to act if they want to explicitly keep or immediately remove. This is the low-friction path: do nothing = reasonable default.

**Periodic cleanup prompt (configurable):**

Based on `cleanup_prompt` setting:
- `after-session`: prompt after every session that used transient resources
- `weekly` (default): once per week if there are expiring transient resources
- `monthly`: once per month
- `never`: fully manual — player uses `ic mod clean` or the content manager

The prompt shows total reclaimable space and a one-click "Clean all expired" button:

```
 Workshop cleanup: 3 resources unused for 30+ days (1.2 GB)
  [Clean all]  [Review individually]  [Remind me later]
```

**In-game Local Content Manager:**

Accessible from the Workshop tab → "My Content" (or a dedicated top-level menu item). This is the player's disk management dashboard:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

The `[···]` action menu per resource:
- **Pin / Unpin** — toggle between pinned and transient
- **Deactivate / Activate** — toggle loading without removing
- **Remove** — delete from disk (dependency-aware prompt)
- **View in Workshop** — open the Workshop page for this resource
- **Show dependents** — what local resources depend on this one
- **Show dependencies** — what this resource requires
- **Open folder** — reveal the resource's cache directory in the file manager

**Bulk operations:** Select multiple resources → Pin all, Deactivate all, Remove all. "Select all transient" and "Select all expiring" shortcuts for quick cleanup.

**"What's using my disk?" view:** A treemap or bar chart showing disk usage by category (Maps, Mods, Resource Packs, Script Libraries) with the largest individual resources highlighted. Helps players identify space hogs quickly. Accessible from the storage summary at the top of the content manager.

**Group operations:**

- **Pin with dependencies:** `ic mod pin alice/total-conversion --with-deps` pins the resource AND all its transitive dependencies. Ensures the entire dependency tree is protected from auto-cleanup.
- **Remove with orphans:** `ic mod remove alice/total-conversion --cascade` removes the resource and any dependencies that become orphaned (no other pinned or transient resource needs them).
- **Modpack-aware:** Pinning a modpack (D030 § Modpacks) pins all resources in the modpack. Removing a modpack removes all resources that were only needed by that modpack.

**How resources from different sources interact:**

| Source                             | Default state             | Auto-cleanup?   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| `ic mod install` (explicit)        | Pinned                    | No              |
| Workshop UI "Install" button       | Pinned                    | No              |
| Lobby auto-download                | Transient                 | Yes (after TTL) |
| Dependency of a pinned resource    | Pinned (inherited)        | No              |
| Dependency of a transient resource | Transient (inherited)     | Yes             |
| `ic workshop import-bundle`        | Pinned                    | No              |
| Steam Workshop subscription        | Pinned (managed by Steam) | Steam handles   |

**Edge case — mixed dependency state:** If resource C is a dependency of both pinned resource A and transient resource B: C is treated as pinned (strongest state wins). If A is later removed, C reverts to transient (inheriting from B). The state is always computed from the dependency graph, not stored independently for shared deps.

**Phase:** Resource states (pinned/transient) and `ic mod remove/deactivate/clean/status` ship in Phase 4–5 with the Workshop. Storage budget and auto-cleanup prompts in Phase 5. In-game content manager UI in Phase 5–6a.

### Continuous Deployment

The `ic` CLI is designed for CI/CD pipelines — every command works headless (no interactive prompts). Authors authenticate via scoped API tokens (`IC_WORKSHOP_TOKEN` environment variable or `--token` flag). Tokens are scoped to specific operations (`publish`, `promote`, `admin`) and expire after a configurable duration. This enables:

- **Tag-triggered publish:** Push a `v1.2.0` git tag → CI validates, tests headless, publishes to Workshop automatically
- **Beta channel CI:** Every merge to `main` publishes to `beta`; explicit tag promotes to `release`
- **Multi-resource monorepos:** Matrix builds publish multiple resource packs from a single repo
- **Automated quality gates:** `ic mod check` + `ic mod test` + `ic mod audit` run before every publish
- **Scheduled compatibility checks:** Cron-triggered CI re-publishes against latest engine version to catch regressions

Works with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Gitea Actions, or any CI system — the CLI is a single static binary. See `04-MODDING.md` § "Continuous Deployment for Workshop Authors" for the full workflow including a GitHub Actions example.

### Script Libraries & Sharing

**Lesson from ArmA/OFP:** ArmA's modding ecosystem thrives partly because the community developed shared script libraries (CBA — Community Base Addons, ACE3's interaction framework, ACRE radio system) that became foundational infrastructure. Mods built on shared libraries instead of reimplementing common patterns. IC makes this a first-class Workshop category.

A Script Library is a Workshop resource containing reusable Lua modules that other mods can depend on:

```yaml
# mod.yaml for a script library resource
mod:
  name: "rts-ai-behaviors"
  category: script-library
  version: "1.0.0"
  license: "MIT"
  description: "Reusable AI behavior patterns for mission scripting"
  exports:
    - "patrol_routes"        # Lua module names available to dependents
    - "guard_behaviors"
    - "retreat_logic"
```

Dependent mods declare the library as a dependency and import its modules:

```lua
-- In a mission script that depends on rts-ai-behaviors
local patrol = require("rts-ai-behaviors.patrol_routes")
local guard  = require("rts-ai-behaviors.guard_behaviors")

patrol.create_route(unit, waypoints, { loop = true, pause_time = 30 })
guard.assign_area(squad, Region.Get("base_perimeter"))
```

**Key design points:**
- Script libraries are Workshop resources with the `script-library` category — they use the same dependency, versioning (semver), and resolution system as any other resource (see Dependency Declaration above)
- `require()` in the Lua sandbox resolves to installed Workshop dependencies, not filesystem paths — maintaining sandbox security
- Libraries are versioned independently — a library author can release 2.0 without breaking mods pinned to `^1.0`
- `ic mod check` validates that all `require()` calls in a mod resolve to declared dependencies
- Script libraries encourage specialization: AI behavior experts publish behavior libraries, UI specialists publish UI helper libraries, campaign designers share narrative utilities

This turns the Lua tier from "every mod reimplements common patterns" into a composable ecosystem — the same shift that made npm/crates.io transformative for their respective communities.

### License System

**Every published Workshop resource MUST have a `license` field.** Publishing without one is rejected.

```yaml
# In mod.yaml or resource manifest
mod:
  license: "CC-BY-SA-4.0"             # SPDX identifier (required for publishing)
```

- Uses [SPDX identifiers](https://spdx.org/licenses/) for machine-readable license classification
- Workshop UI displays license prominently on every resource listing
- `ic mod audit` checks the full dependency tree for license compatibility (e.g., CC-BY-NC dep in a CC-BY mod → warning)
- Common licenses for game assets: `CC-BY-4.0`, `CC-BY-SA-4.0`, `CC-BY-NC-4.0`, `CC0-1.0`, `MIT`, `GPL-3.0-only`, `LicenseRef-Custom` (with link to full text)
- Resources with incompatible licenses can coexist in the Workshop but `ic mod audit` warns when combining them
- **Optional EULA** for authors who need additional terms beyond SPDX (e.g., "no use in commercial products without written permission"). EULA cannot contradict the SPDX license. See `04-MODDING.md` § "Optional EULA"
- **Workshop Terms of Service (platform license):** By publishing, authors grant the platform minimum rights to host, cache, replicate, index, generate previews, serve as dependency, and auto-download in multiplayer — regardless of the resource's declared license. Same model as GitHub/npm/Steam Workshop. The ToS does not expand what *recipients* can do (that's the license) — it ensures the platform can mechanically operate. See `04-MODDING.md` § "Workshop Terms of Service"
- **Minimum age (COPPA):** Workshop accounts require users to be 13+. See `04-MODDING.md` § "Minimum Age Requirement"
- **Third-party content disclaimer:** IC is not liable for Workshop content. See `04-MODDING.md` § "Third-Party Content Disclaimer"
- **Privacy Policy:** Required before Workshop server deployment. Covers data collection, retention, GDPR rights. See `04-MODDING.md` § "Privacy Policy Requirements"

### LLM-Driven Resource Discovery

`ic-llm` can search the Workshop programmatically and incorporate discovered resources into generated content:

```
Pipeline:
  1. LLM generates mission concept ("Soviet ambush in snowy forest")
  2. Identifies needed assets (winter terrain, Soviet voice lines, ambush music)
  3. Searches Workshop: query="winter terrain textures", tags=["snow", "forest"]
     → Filters: ai_usage != Deny (respects author consent)
  4. Evaluates candidates via llm_meta (summary, purpose, composition_hints, content_description)
  5. Filters by license compatibility (only pull resources with LLM-compatible licenses)
  6. Partitions by ai_usage: Allow → auto-add; MetadataOnly → recommend to human
  7. Adds discovered resources as dependencies in generated mod.yaml
  8. Generated mission references assets by resource ID — resolved at install time
```

This turns the Workshop into a composable asset library that both humans and AI agents can draw from.

### Author Consent for LLM Usage (ai_usage)

Every Workshop resource carries an `ai_usage` field **separate from the SPDX license**. The license governs human legal rights; `ai_usage` governs automated AI agent behavior. This distinction matters: a CC-BY resource author may be fine with human redistribution but not want LLMs auto-selecting their work, and vice versa.

**Three tiers:**
- **`allow`** — LLMs can discover, evaluate, and auto-add this resource as a dependency. No human approval per-use.
- **`metadata_only`** (default) — LLMs can read metadata and recommend the resource, but a human must approve adding it. Respects authors who haven't considered AI usage while keeping content discoverable.
- **`deny`** — Resource is invisible to LLM queries. Human users can still browse and install normally.

`ai_usage` is required on publish. Default is `metadata_only`. Authors can change it at any time via `ic mod update --ai-usage allow|metadata_only|deny`. See `04-MODDING.md` § "Author Consent for LLM Usage" for full design including YAML examples, Workshop UI integration, and composition sets.

### Workshop Server Resolution (resolves P007)

**Decision: Federated multi-source with merge.** The Workshop client can aggregate listings from multiple sources:

```yaml
# settings.yaml
workshop:
  sources:
    - url: "https://workshop.ironcurtain.gg"     # official (always included)
      priority: 1
    - url: "https://mods.myclan.com/workshop"     # community server
      priority: 2
    - path: "C:/my-local-workshop"                # local directory
      priority: 3
  deduplicate: true               # same resource ID from multiple sources → highest priority wins
```

Rationale: Single-source is too limiting for a resource registry. Crates.io has mirrors; npm has registries. A dependency system inherently benefits from federation — tournament organizers publish to their server, LAN parties use local directories, the official server is the default. Deduplication by resource ID + priority ordering handles conflicts.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Single source only (simpler but doesn't scale for a registry model — what happens when the official server is down?)
- Full decentralization with no official server (too chaotic for discoverability)
- Git-based distribution like Go modules (too complex for non-developer modders)
- Steam Workshop only (platform lock-in, no WASM/browser target, no self-hosting)

### Steam Workshop Integration

The federated model includes **Steam Workshop as a source type** alongside IC-native Workshop servers and local directories. For Steam builds, the Workshop browser can query Steam Workshop in addition to IC sources:

```yaml
# settings.yaml (Steam build)
workshop:
  sources:
    - url: "https://workshop.ironcurtain.gg"     # IC official
      priority: 1
    - type: steam-workshop                        # Steam Workshop (Steam builds only)
      app_id: <steam_app_id>
      priority: 2
    - path: "C:/my-local-workshop"
      priority: 3
```

- **Publish to both:** `ic mod publish` uploads to IC Workshop; Steam builds additionally push to Steam Workshop via Steamworks API. One command, dual publish.
- **Subscribe from either:** IC resources and Steam Workshop items appear in the same in-game browser (virtual view merges them).
- **Non-Steam builds are not disadvantaged.** IC's own Workshop is the primary registry. Steam Workshop is an optional distribution channel that broadens reach for creators on Steam.
- **Maps are the primary Steam Workshop content type** (matching Remastered's pattern). Full mods are better served by the IC Workshop due to richer metadata, dependency resolution, and federation.

### In-Game Workshop Browser

The Workshop is accessible from the main menu, not only via the `ic` CLI. The in-game browser provides:

- **Search** with full-text search (FTS5 via D034), category filters, tag filters, and sorting (popular, recent, trending, most-depended-on)
- **Resource detail pages** with description, screenshots/preview, license, author, download count, rating, dependency tree, changelog
- **One-click install** with automatic dependency resolution — same as `ic mod install` but from the game UI
- **Ratings and reviews** — 1-5 star rating plus optional text review per user per resource
- **Creator profiles** — browse all resources by a specific author, see their total downloads, reputation badges
- **Collections** — user-curated lists of resources ("My Competitive Setup", "Best Soviet Music"), shareable via link
- **Trending and featured** — algorithmically surfaced (time-weighted download velocity) plus editorially curated featured lists

### Auto-Download on Lobby Join

When a player joins a multiplayer lobby, the game automatically resolves and downloads any required mods, maps, or resource packs that the player doesn't have locally:

1. **Lobby advertises requirements:** The `GameListing` (see `03-NETCODE.md`) includes mod ID, version, and Workshop source for all required resources
2. **Client checks local cache:** Already have the exact version? Skip download.
3. **Missing resources auto-resolve:** Client queries the virtual Workshop repository, downloads missing resources via P2P (BitTorrent/WebTorrent — D049) with HTTP fallback. Lobby peers are prioritized as download sources (they already have the required content).
4. **Progress UI:** Download progress bar shown in lobby with source indicator (P2P/HTTP). Game start blocked until all players have all required resources.
5. **Rejection option:** Player can decline to download and leave the lobby instead.
6. **Size warning:** Downloads exceeding a configurable threshold (default 100MB) prompt confirmation before proceeding.

This matches CS:GO/CS2's pattern where community maps download automatically when joining a server — zero friction for players. It also solves ArmA Reforger's most-cited community complaint about mod management friction. P2P delivery means lobby auto-download is fast (peers in the same lobby are direct seeds) and free (no CDN cost per join). See D052 § "In-Lobby P2P Resource Sharing" for the full lobby protocol: room discovery, host-as-tracker, security model, and verification flow.

**Local resource lifecycle:** Resources downloaded this way are tagged as **transient** (not pinned). They remain fully functional but are subject to auto-cleanup after `transient_ttl_days` (default 30 days) of non-use. After the session, a non-intrusive toast offers: "[Pin (keep forever)] [They'll auto-clean in 30 days] [Remove now]". Frequently-used transient resources (3+ sessions) are automatically promoted to pinned. See D030 § "Local Resource Management" for the full lifecycle, storage budget, and cleanup UX.

### Creator Reputation System

Creators accumulate reputation through their Workshop activity. Reputation is displayed on resource listings and creator profiles:

| Signal              | Weight   | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Total downloads     | Medium   | Cumulative downloads across all published resources                         |
| Average rating      | High     | Mean star rating across published resources (minimum 10 ratings to display) |
| Dependency count    | High     | How many other resources/mods depend on this creator's work                 |
| Publish consistency | Low      | Regular updates and new content over time                                   |
| Community reports   | Negative | DMCA strikes, policy violations reduce reputation                           |

**Badges:**
- **Verified** — identity confirmed (e.g., linked GitHub account)
- **Prolific** — 10+ published resources with ≥4.0 average rating
- **Foundation** — resources depended on by 50+ other resources
- **Curator** — maintains high-quality curated collections

Reputation is displayed but not gatekeeping — any registered user can publish. Reputation helps players discover trustworthy content in a growing registry.

### Content Moderation & DMCA/Takedown Policy

The Workshop requires a clear content policy and takedown process:

**Prohibited content:**
- Assets ripped from commercial games without permission (the ArmA community's perennial problem)
- Malicious content (WASM modules with harmful behavior — mitigated by capability sandbox)
- Content violating the license declared in its manifest
- Hate speech, illegal content (standard platform policy)

**Takedown process:**
1. **Reporter files takedown request** via Workshop UI or email, specifying the resource and the claim (DMCA, license violation, policy violation)
2. **Resource is flagged** — not immediately removed — and the author is notified with a 72-hour response window
3. **Author can counter-claim** (e.g., they hold the rights, the reporter is mistaken)
4. **Workshop moderators review** — if the claim is valid, the resource is delisted (not deleted — remains in local caches of existing users)
5. **Repeat offenders** accumulate strikes. Three strikes → account publishing privileges suspended. Appeals process available.
6. **DMCA safe harbor:** The Workshop server operator (official or community-hosted) follows standard DMCA safe harbor procedures. Community-hosted servers set their own moderation policies.

**License enforcement integration:**
- `ic mod audit` already checks dependency tree license compatibility
- Workshop server rejects publish if declared license conflicts with dependency licenses
- Resources with `LicenseRef-Custom` must provide a URL to full license text

**Rationale (from ArmA research):** ArmA's private mod ecosystem exists specifically because the Workshop can't protect creators or manage IP claims. Disney, EA, and others actively DMCA ArmA Workshop content. Bohemia established an IP ban list but the community found it heavy-handed. IC's approach: clear rules, due process, creator notification first — not immediate removal.

**Phase:** Minimal Workshop in Phase 4–5 (central server + publish + browse + auto-download); full Workshop (federation, Steam source, reputation, DMCA) in Phase 6a; preparatory work in Phase 3 (manifest format finalized).

## D035: Creator Recognition & Attribution

**Decision:** The Workshop supports **voluntary creator recognition** through tipping/sponsorship links and reputation badges. Monetization is never mandatory — all Workshop resources are freely downloadable. Creators can optionally accept tips and link sponsorship profiles.

**Rationale:**
- The C&C modding community has a 30-year culture of free modding. Mandatory paid content would generate massive resistance and fragment multiplayer (can't join a game if you don't own a required paid map — ArmA DLC demonstrated this problem).
- Valve's Steam Workshop paid mods experiment (Skyrim, 2015) was reversed within days due to community backlash. The 75/25 revenue split (Valve/creator) was seen as exploitative.
- Nexus Mods' Donation Points system is well-received as a voluntary model — creators earn money without gating access.
- CS:GO/CS2's creator economy ($57M+ paid to creators by 2015) works because it's cosmetic-only items curated by Valve — a fundamentally different model than gating gameplay content.
- ArmA's commissioned mod ecosystem exists in a legal/ethical gray zone with no official framework — creators deserve better.
- Backend infrastructure (relay servers, Workshop servers, tracking servers) has real hosting costs. Sustainability requires some revenue model.

**Key Design Elements:**

### Creator Tipping

- **Tip jar on resource pages:** Every Workshop resource page has an optional "Support this creator" button. Clicking shows the creator's configured payment links.
- **Payment links, not payment processing.** IC does not process payments directly. Creators link their own payment platforms:

```yaml
# In mod.yaml or creator profile
creator:
  name: "Alice"
  tip_links:
    - platform: "ko-fi"
      url: "https://ko-fi.com/alice"
    - platform: "github-sponsors"
      url: "https://github.com/sponsors/alice"
    - platform: "patreon"
      url: "https://patreon.com/alice"
    - platform: "paypal"
      url: "https://paypal.me/alice"
```

- **No IC platform fee on tips.** Tips go directly to creators via their chosen platform. IC takes zero cut.
- **Aggregate tip link on creator profile:** Creator's profile page shows a single "Support Alice" button linking to their preferred platform.

### Infrastructure Sustainability

The Workshop and backend servers have hosting costs. Sustainability options (not mutually exclusive):

| Model                        | Description                                                                                                   | Precedent                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Community donations**      | Open Collective / GitHub Sponsors for the project itself                                                      | Godot, Blender, Bevy                |
| **Premium hosting tier**     | Optional paid tier: priority matchmaking queue, larger replay archive, custom clan pages                      | Discord Nitro, private game servers |
| **Sponsored featured slots** | Creators or communities pay to feature resources in the Workshop's "Featured" section                         | App Store featured placements       |
| **White-label licensing**    | Tournament organizers or game communities license the engine+infrastructure for their own branded deployments | Many open-source projects           |

**No mandatory paywalls.** The free tier is fully functional — all gameplay features, all maps, all mods, all multiplayer. Premium tiers offer convenience and visibility, never exclusive gameplay content.

**No loot boxes, no skin gambling, no speculative economy.** CS:GO's skin economy generated massive revenue but also attracted gambling sites, scams, and regulatory scrutiny. IC's creator recognition model is direct and transparent.

### Future Expansion Path

The Workshop schema supports monetization metadata from day one, but launches with tips-only:

```yaml
# Future schema (not implemented at launch)
mod:
  pricing:
    model: "free"                    # free | tip | paid (paid = future)
    tip_links: [...]                 # voluntary compensation
    # price: "2.99"                  # future: optional price for premium content
    # revenue_split: "70/30"         # future: creator/platform split
```

If the community evolves toward wanting paid content (e.g., professional-quality campaign packs), the schema is ready. But this is a community decision, not a launch feature.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Mandatory marketplace (Skyrim paid mods disaster — community backlash guaranteed)
- Revenue share on all downloads (creates perverse incentives, fragments multiplayer)
- No monetization at all (unsustainable for infrastructure; undervalues creators)
- EA premium content pathway (licensing conflicts with open-source, gives EA control the community should own)

**Phase:** Phase 6a (integrated with Workshop infrastructure), with creator profile schema defined in Phase 3.

---

## D036: Achievement System

**Decision:** IC includes a **per-game-module achievement system** with built-in and mod-defined achievements, stored locally in SQLite (D034), with optional Workshop sync for community-created achievement packs.

**Rationale:**
- Achievements provide progression and engagement outside competitive ranking — important for casual players who are the majority of the C&C community
- Modern RTS players expect achievement systems (Remastered, SC2, AoE4 all have them)
- Mod-defined achievements drive Workshop adoption: a total conversion mod can define its own achievement set, incentivizing players to explore community content
- SQLite storage (D034) already handles all persistent client state — achievements are another table

**Key Design Elements:**

### Achievement Categories

| Category        | Examples                                                                      | Scope                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Campaign**    | "Complete Allied Campaign on Hard", "Zero casualties in mission 3"            | Per-game-module, per-campaign |
| **Skirmish**    | "Win with only infantry", "Defeat 3 brutal AIs simultaneously"                | Per-game-module               |
| **Multiplayer** | "Win 10 ranked matches", "Achieve 200 APM in a match"                         | Per-game-module, per-mode     |
| **Exploration** | "Play every official map", "Try all factions"                                 | Per-game-module               |
| **Community**   | "Install 5 Workshop mods", "Rate 10 Workshop resources", "Publish a resource" | Cross-module                  |
| **Mod-defined** | Defined by mod authors in YAML, registered via Workshop                       | Per-mod                       |

### Storage Schema (D034)

```sql
CREATE TABLE achievements (
    id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,     -- "ra1.campaign.allied_hard_complete"
    game_module     TEXT NOT NULL,        -- "ra1", "td", "ra2"
    category        TEXT NOT NULL,        -- "campaign", "skirmish", "multiplayer", "community"
    title           TEXT NOT NULL,
    description     TEXT NOT NULL,
    icon            TEXT,                 -- path to achievement icon asset
    hidden          BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,    -- hidden until unlocked (surprise achievements)
    source          TEXT NOT NULL         -- "builtin" or workshop resource ID
);

CREATE TABLE achievement_progress (
    achievement_id  TEXT REFERENCES achievements(id),
    unlocked_at     TEXT,                 -- ISO 8601 timestamp, NULL if locked
    progress        INTEGER DEFAULT 0,    -- for multi-step achievements (e.g., "win 10 matches": progress=7)
    target          INTEGER DEFAULT 1,    -- total required for unlock
    PRIMARY KEY (achievement_id)
);
```

### Mod-Defined Achievements

Mod authors define achievements in their `mod.yaml`, which register when the mod is installed:

```yaml
# mod.yaml (achievement definition in a mod)
achievements:
  - id: "my_mod.survive_the_storm"
    title: "Eye of the Storm"
    description: "Survive a blizzard event without losing any buildings"
    category: skirmish
    icon: "assets/achievements/storm.png"
    hidden: false
    trigger: "lua"                     # unlock logic in Lua script
  - id: "my_mod.build_all_units"
    title: "Full Arsenal"
    description: "Build every unit type in a single match"
    category: skirmish
    icon: "assets/achievements/arsenal.png"
    trigger: "lua"
```

Lua scripts call `Achievement.unlock("my_mod.survive_the_storm")` when conditions are met. The achievement API is part of the Lua globals (alongside `Actor`, `Trigger`, `Map`, etc.).

### Design Constraints

- **No multiplayer achievements that incentivize griefing.** "Kill 100 allied units" → no. "Win 10 team games" → yes.
- **Campaign achievements are deterministic** — same inputs, same achievement unlock. Replays can verify achievement legitimacy.
- **Achievement packs are Workshop resources** — community can create themed achievement collections (e.g., "Speedrun Challenges", "Pacifist Run").
- **Mod achievements are sandboxed to their mod.** Uninstalling a mod hides its achievements (progress preserved, shown as "mod not installed").
- **Steam achievements sync** (Steam builds only) — built-in achievements map to Steam achievement API. Mod-defined achievements are IC-only.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Steam achievements only (excludes non-Steam players, can't support mod-defined achievements)
- No achievement system (misses engagement opportunity, feels incomplete vs modern RTS competitors)
- Blockchain-verified achievements (needless complexity, community hostility toward crypto/blockchain in games)

**Phase:** Phase 3 (built-in achievement infrastructure + campaign achievements), Phase 6b (mod-defined achievements via Workshop).

## D037: Community Governance & Platform Stewardship

**Decision:** IC's community infrastructure (Workshop, tracking servers, competitive systems) operates under a **transparent governance model** with community representation, clear policies, and distributed authority.

**Rationale:**
- OpenRA's community fragmented partly because governance was opaque — balance changes and feature decisions were made by a small core team without structured community input, leading to the "OpenRA isn't RA1" sentiment
- ArmA's Workshop moderation is perceived as inconsistent — some IP holders get mods removed, others don't, with no clear published policy
- CNCnet succeeds partly because it's community-run with clear ownership
- The Workshop (D030) and competitive systems create platform responsibilities: content moderation, balance curation, server uptime, dispute resolution. These need defined ownership.
- Self-hosting is a first-class use case (D030 federation) — governance must work even when the official infrastructure is one of many

**Key Design Elements:**

### Governance Structure

| Role                          | Responsibility                                                               | Selection                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Project maintainer(s)**     | Engine code, architecture decisions, release schedule                        | Existing (repository owners)                                 |
| **Workshop moderators**       | Content moderation, DMCA processing, policy enforcement                      | Appointed by maintainers, community nominations              |
| **Competitive committee**     | Ranked map pool, balance preset curation, tournament rules                   | Elected by active ranked players (annual)                    |
| **Game module stewards**      | Per-module balance/content decisions (RA1 steward, TD steward, etc.)         | Appointed by maintainers based on community contributions    |
| **Community representatives** | Advocate for community needs, surface pain points, vote on pending decisions | Elected by community (annual), at least one per major region |

### Transparency Commitments

- **Public decision log** (this document) for all architectural and policy decisions
- **Monthly community reports** for Workshop statistics (uploads, downloads, moderation actions, takedowns)
- **Open moderation log** for Workshop takedown actions (stripped of personal details) — the community can see what was removed and why
- **RFC process for major changes:** Balance preset modifications, Workshop policy changes, and competitive rule changes go through a public comment period before adoption
- **Community surveys** before major decisions that affect gameplay experience (annually at minimum)

### Self-Hosting Independence

The governance model explicitly supports community independence:

- Any community can host their own Workshop server, tracking server, and relay server
- Federation (D030) means community servers are peers, not subordinates to the official infrastructure
- If the official project becomes inactive, the community has all the tools, source code, and infrastructure to continue independently
- Community-hosted servers set their own moderation policies (within the framework of clear minimum standards for federated discovery)

### Community Groups

**Lesson from ArmA/OFP:** The ArmA community's longevity (25+ years) owes much to its clan/unit culture — persistent groups with shared mod lists, server configurations, and identity. IC supports this natively rather than leaving it to Discord servers and spreadsheets.

Community groups are lightweight persistent entities in the Workshop/tracking infrastructure:

| Feature                | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Group identity**     | Name, tag, icon, description — displayed in lobby and in-game alongside player names                     |
| **Shared mod list**    | Group-curated list of Workshop resources. Members click "Sync" to install the group's mod configuration. |
| **Shared server list** | Preferred relay/tracking servers. Members auto-connect to the group's servers.                           |
| **Group achievements** | Community achievements (D036) scoped to group activities — "Play 50 matches with your group"             |
| **Private lobbies**    | Group members can create password-free lobbies visible only to other members                             |

Groups are **not** competitive clans (no group rankings, no group matchmaking). They are social infrastructure — a way for communities of players to share configurations and find each other. Competitive team features (team ratings, team matchmaking) are separate and independent.

**Storage:** Group metadata stored in SQLite (D034) on the tracking/Workshop server. Groups are federated — a group created on a community tracking server is visible to members who have that server in their `settings.yaml` sources list. No central authority over group creation.

**Phase:** Phase 5 (alongside multiplayer infrastructure). Minimal viable implementation: group identity + shared mod list + private lobbies. Group achievements and server lists in Phase 6a.

### Community Knowledge Base

**Lesson from ArmA/OFP:** ArmA's community wiki (Community Wiki — formerly BI Wiki) is one of the most comprehensive game modding references ever assembled, entirely community-maintained. OpenRA has scattered documentation across GitHub wiki pages, the OpenRA book, mod docs, and third-party tutorials — no single authoritative reference.

IC ships a structured knowledge base alongside the Workshop:

- **Engine wiki** — community-editable documentation for engine features, YAML schema reference, Lua API reference, WASM host functions. Seeded with auto-generated content from the typed schema (every YAML field and Lua global gets a stub page).
- **Modding tutorials** — structured guides from "first YAML change" through "WASM total conversion." Community members can submit and edit tutorials.
- **Map-making guides** — scenario editor documentation with annotated examples.
- **Community cookbook** — recipe-style pages: "How to add a new unit type," "How to create a branching campaign," "How to publish a resource pack." Short, copy-pasteable, maintained by the community.

**Implementation:** The knowledge base is a static site (mdbook or similar) with source in a public git repository. Community contributions via pull requests — same workflow as code contributions. Auto-generated API reference pages are rebuilt on each engine release. The in-game help system links to knowledge base pages contextually (e.g., the scenario editor's trigger panel links to the triggers documentation).

**Not a forum.** The knowledge base is reference documentation, not discussion. Community discussion happens on whatever platforms the community chooses (Discord, forums, etc.). IC provides infrastructure for shared knowledge, not social interaction beyond Community Groups.

**Phase:** Phase 4 (auto-generated API reference from Lua/YAML schema). Phase 6a (community-editable tutorials, cookbook). Seeded by the project maintainer during development — the design docs themselves are the initial knowledge base.

### Creator Content Program

**Lesson from ArmA/OFP:** Bohemia Interactive's Creator DLC program (launched 2019) showed that a structured quality ladder — from hobbyist to featured to commercially published — works when the criteria are transparent and the community governs curation. The program produced professional-quality content (Global Mobilization, S.O.G. Prairie Fire, CSLA Iron Curtain) while keeping the free modding ecosystem healthy.

IC adapts this concept within D035's voluntary framework (no mandatory paywalls, no IC platform fee):

| Tier            | Criteria                                                                                  | Recognition                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Published**   | Meets Workshop minimum standards (valid metadata, license declared, no malware)           | Listed in Workshop, available for search and dependency                                            |
| **Reviewed**    | Passes community review (2+ moderator approvals for quality, completeness, documentation) | "Reviewed" badge on Workshop page, eligible for "Staff Picks" featured section                     |
| **Featured**    | Selected by Workshop moderators or competitive committee for exceptional quality          | Promoted in Workshop "Featured" section, highlighted in in-game browser, included in starter packs |
| **Spotlighted** | Seasonal showcase — community-voted "best of" for maps, mods, campaigns, and assets       | Front-page placement, social media promotion, creator interview/spotlight                          |

**Key differences from Bohemia's Creator DLC:**
- **No paid tier at launch.** All tiers are free. D035's future `paid` pricing model is available if the community evolves toward it, but the quality ladder operates independently of monetization.
- **Community curation, not publisher curation.** Workshop moderators and the competitive committee (both community roles) make tier decisions, not the project maintainer.
- **Transparent criteria.** Published criteria for each tier — creators know exactly what's needed to reach "Reviewed" or "Featured" status.
- **No exclusive distribution.** Featured content is Workshop content — it can be forked, depended on, and mirrored. No lock-in.

The Creator Content Program is a recognition and quality signal system, not a gatekeeping mechanism. The Workshop remains open to all — tiers help players find high-quality content, not restrict who can publish.

**Phase:** Phase 6a (integrated with Workshop moderator role from D037 governance structure). "Published" tier is automatic from Workshop launch (Phase 4–5). "Reviewed" and "Featured" require active moderators.

### Code of Conduct

Standard open-source code of conduct (Contributor Covenant or similar) applies to:
- Workshop resource descriptions and reviews
- In-game chat (client-side filtering, not server enforcement for non-ranked games)
- Competitive play (ranked games: stricter enforcement, report system, temporary bans for verified toxicity)
- Community forums and communication channels

**Alternatives considered:**
- BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) model with no community input (faster decisions but risks OpenRA's fate — community alienation)
- Full democracy (too slow for a game project; bikeshedding on every decision)
- Corporate governance (inappropriate for an open-source community project)
- No formal governance (works early, creates problems at scale — better to define structure before it's needed)

**Phase:** Phase 0 (code of conduct, contribution guidelines), Phase 5 (competitive committee), Phase 7 (Workshop moderators, community representatives).

> **Phasing note:** This governance model is aspirational — it describes where the project aims to be at scale, not what launches on day one. At project start, governance is BDFL (maintainer) + trusted contributors, which is appropriate for a project with zero users. Formal elections, committees, and community representatives should not be implemented until there is an active community of 50+ regular contributors. The governance structure documented here is a roadmap, not a launch requirement. Premature formalization risks creating bureaucracy before there are people to govern.

## D031: Observability & Telemetry — OTEL Across Engine, Servers, and AI Pipeline

**Decision:** All components — game client, relay server, tracking server, workshop server — record structured telemetry to local SQLite as the primary sink. Every component runs fully offline; no telemetry depends on external infrastructure. OTEL (OpenTelemetry) is an optional export layer for server operators who want Grafana dashboards — it is never a requirement. The instrumentation layer is unified across all components, enabling operational monitoring, gameplay debugging, GUI usage analysis, pattern discovery, and AI/LLM training data collection.

**Rationale:**
- Backend servers (relay, tracking, workshop) are production infrastructure — they need health metrics, latency histograms, error rates, and distributed traces, just like any microservice
- The game engine already has rich internal state (per-tick `state_hash()`, snapshots, system execution times) but no structured way to export it for analysis
- Replay files capture *what happened* but not *why* — telemetry captures the engine's decision-making process (pathfinding time, order validation outcomes, combat resolution details) that replays miss
- Behavioral analysis (V12 anti-cheat) already collects APM, reaction times, and input entropy on the relay — OTEL is the natural export format for this data
- AI/LLM development needs training data: game telemetry (unit movements, build orders, engagement outcomes) is exactly the training corpus for `ic-ai` and `ic-llm`
- Bevy already integrates with Rust's `tracing` crate — OTEL export is a natural extension, not a foreign addition
- **Stack validated by production Rust game infrastructure:** Embark Studios' Quilkin (production game relay) uses the exact `tracing` + `prometheus` + OTEL stack IC targets, confirming it handles real game traffic at scale. Puffin (Embark's frame-based profiler) complements OTEL for per-tick instrumentation with ~1ns disabled overhead. IC's "zero cost when disabled" requirement is satisfied by puffin's `AtomicBool` guard and tracing's compile-time level filtering. See `research/embark-studios-rust-gamedev-analysis.md`
- Desync debugging needs cross-client correlation — distributed tracing (trace IDs) lets you follow an order from input → network → sim → render across multiple clients and the relay server
- A single instrumentation approach (OTEL) avoids the mess of ad-hoc logging, custom metrics files, separate debug protocols, and incompatible formats

**Key Design Elements:**

### Unified Local-First Storage

**Every component records telemetry to a local SQLite file. No exceptions.** This is the same principle as D034 (SQLite as embedded storage) and D061 (local-first data) applied to telemetry. The game client, relay server, tracking server, and workshop server all write to their own `telemetry.db` using an identical schema. No component depends on an external collector, dashboard, or aggregation service to function.

```sql
-- Identical schema on every component (client, relay, tracking, workshop)
CREATE TABLE telemetry_events (
    id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp     TEXT    NOT NULL,        -- ISO 8601 with microsecond precision
    session_id    TEXT    NOT NULL,        -- random per-process-lifetime
    component     TEXT    NOT NULL,        -- 'client', 'relay', 'tracking', 'workshop'
    game_module   TEXT,                    -- 'ra1', 'td', 'ra2', custom — set once per session (NULL on servers)
    mod_fingerprint TEXT,                  -- D062 SHA-256 mod profile fingerprint — updated on profile switch
    category      TEXT    NOT NULL,        -- event domain (see taxonomy below)
    event         TEXT    NOT NULL,        -- specific event name
    severity      TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT 'info',  -- 'trace','debug','info','warn','error'
    data          TEXT,                    -- JSON payload (structured, no PII)
    duration_us   INTEGER,                -- for events with measurable duration
    tick          INTEGER,                -- sim tick (gameplay/sim events only)
    correlation   TEXT                     -- trace ID for cross-component correlation
);

CREATE INDEX idx_telemetry_ts          ON telemetry_events(timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_telemetry_cat_event   ON telemetry_events(category, event);
CREATE INDEX idx_telemetry_session     ON telemetry_events(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_telemetry_game_module ON telemetry_events(game_module) WHERE game_module IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_telemetry_mod_fp      ON telemetry_events(mod_fingerprint) WHERE mod_fingerprint IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_telemetry_severity    ON telemetry_events(severity) WHERE severity IN ('warn', 'error');
CREATE INDEX idx_telemetry_correlation ON telemetry_events(correlation) WHERE correlation IS NOT NULL;
```

**Why one schema everywhere?** Aggregation scripts, debugging tools, and community analysis all work identically regardless of source. A relay operator can run the same `/analytics export` command as a player. Exported files from different components can be imported into a single SQLite database for cross-component analysis (desync debugging across client + relay). The aggregation tooling is a handful of SQL queries, not a specialized backend.

**Mod-agnostic by design, mod-aware by context.** The telemetry schema contains zero game-specific or mod-specific columns. Unit types, weapon names, building names, and resource types flow through as opaque strings — whatever the active mod's YAML defines. A total conversion mod's custom vocabulary (e.g., `unit_type: "Mammoth Mk.III"`) passes through unchanged without schema modification. The two denormalized context columns — `game_module` and `mod_fingerprint` — are set once per session on the client (updated on `ic profile activate` if the player switches mod profiles mid-session). On servers, these columns are populated per-game from lobby metadata. This means **every analytical query can be trivially filtered by game module or mod combination** without JOINing through `session.start`'s JSON payload:

```sql
-- Direct mod filtering — no JOINs needed
SELECT event, COUNT(*) FROM telemetry_events
WHERE game_module = 'ra1' AND category = 'input'
GROUP BY event ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Compare behavior across mod profiles
SELECT mod_fingerprint, AVG(json_extract(data, '$.apm')) AS avg_apm
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'match.pace'
GROUP BY mod_fingerprint;
```

**Relay servers** set `game_module` and `mod_fingerprint` per-game from the lobby's negotiated settings — all events for that game inherit the context. When the relay hosts multiple concurrent games with different mods, each game's events carry the correct mod context independently.

**OTEL is an optional export layer, not the primary sink.** Server operators who want real-time dashboards (Grafana, Prometheus, Jaeger) can enable OTEL export — but it's a "nice-to-have" for sophisticated deployments, not a dependency. A community member running a relay server on a spare machine doesn't need to set up Prometheus. They get full telemetry in a SQLite file they can query with any SQL tool.

**Retention and rotation:** Each component's `telemetry.db` has a configurable max size (default: 100 MB for client, 500 MB for servers). When the limit is reached, the oldest events are pruned. `/analytics export` exports a date range to a separate file before pruning. Servers can also configure time-based retention (e.g., `telemetry.retention_days = 30`).

### Three Telemetry Signals (OTEL Standard)

| Signal  | What It Captures                                                  | Export Format        |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Metrics | Counters, histograms, gauges — numeric time series                | OTLP → Prometheus    |
| Traces  | Distributed request flows — an order's journey through the system | OTLP → Jaeger/Zipkin |
| Logs    | Structured events with severity, context, correlation IDs         | OTLP → Loki/stdout   |

### Backend Server Telemetry (Relay, Tracking, Workshop)

Standard operational observability — same patterns used by any production Rust service. **All servers record to local SQLite** (`telemetry.db`) using the unified schema above. The OTEL metric names below double as the `event` field in the SQLite table — operators can query locally via SQL or optionally export to Prometheus/Grafana.

**Relay server metrics:**
```
relay.games.active                    # gauge: concurrent games
relay.games.total                     # counter: total games hosted
relay.orders.received                 # counter: orders received per tick
relay.orders.forwarded                # counter: orders broadcast
relay.orders.dropped                  # counter: orders missed (lag switch)
relay.tick.latency_ms                 # histogram: tick processing time
relay.player.rtt_ms                   # histogram: per-player round-trip time
relay.player.suspicion_score          # gauge: behavioral analysis score (V12)
relay.desync.detected                 # counter: desync events
relay.match.completed                 # counter: matches finished
relay.match.duration_s                # histogram: match duration
```

**Tracking server metrics:**
```
tracking.listings.active              # gauge: current game listings
tracking.heartbeats.received          # counter: heartbeats processed
tracking.heartbeats.expired           # counter: listings expired (TTL)
tracking.queries.total                # counter: browse/search requests
tracking.queries.latency_ms           # histogram: query latency
```

**Workshop server metrics:**
```
workshop.resources.total              # gauge: total published resources
workshop.resources.downloads          # counter: download events
workshop.resources.publishes          # counter: publish events
workshop.resolve.latency_ms           # histogram: dependency resolution time
workshop.resolve.conflicts            # counter: version conflicts detected
workshop.search.latency_ms            # histogram: search query time
```

#### Server-Side Structured Events (SQLite)

Beyond counters and gauges, each server records detailed structured events to `telemetry.db`. These are the events that actually enable troubleshooting and pattern analysis:

**Relay server events:**

| Event                 | JSON `data` Fields                                                                                            | Troubleshooting Value                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `relay.game.start`    | `game_id`, `map`, `player_count`, `settings_hash`, `balance_preset`, `game_module`, `mod_profile_fingerprint` | Which maps/settings/mods are popular?                       |
| `relay.game.end`      | `game_id`, `duration_s`, `ticks`, `outcome`, `player_count`                                                   | Match length distribution, completion vs. abandonment rates |
| `relay.player.join`   | `game_id`, `slot`, `rtt_ms`, `mod_profile_fingerprint`                                                        | Connection quality at join time, mod compatibility          |
| `relay.player.leave`  | `game_id`, `slot`, `reason` (quit/disconnect/kicked/timeout), `match_time_s`                                  | Why and when players leave — early ragequit vs. end-of-game |
| `relay.tick.process`  | `game_id`, `tick`, `order_count`, `process_us`, `stall_detected`                                              | Per-tick performance, stall diagnosis                       |
| `relay.order.forward` | `game_id`, `player`, `tick`, `order_type`, `sub_tick_us`, `size_bytes`                                        | Order volume, sub-tick fairness verification                |
| `relay.desync`        | `game_id`, `tick`, `diverged_players[]`, `hash_expected`, `hash_actual`                                       | Desync diagnosis — which tick, which players                |
| `relay.lag_switch`    | `game_id`, `player`, `gap_ms`, `orders_during_gap`                                                            | Cheating detection audit trail                              |
| `relay.suspicion`     | `game_id`, `player`, `score`, `contributing_factors{}`                                                        | Behavioral analysis transparency                            |

**Tracking server events:**

| Event                     | JSON `data` Fields                                                           | Troubleshooting Value                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `tracking.listing.create` | `game_id`, `map`, `host_hash`, `settings_summary`                            | Game creation patterns                |
| `tracking.listing.expire` | `game_id`, `age_s`, `reason` (TTL/host_departed)                             | Why games disappear from the browser  |
| `tracking.query`          | `query_type` (browse/search/filter), `params`, `results_count`, `latency_ms` | Search effectiveness, popular filters |

**Workshop server events:**

| Event               | JSON `data` Fields                                          | Troubleshooting Value                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `workshop.publish`  | `resource_id`, `type`, `version`, `size_bytes`, `dep_count` | Publishing patterns, resource sizes               |
| `workshop.download` | `resource_id`, `version`, `requester_hash`, `latency_ms`    | Download volume, popular resources                |
| `workshop.resolve`  | `root_resource`, `dep_count`, `conflicts`, `latency_ms`     | Dependency hell frequency, resolution performance |
| `workshop.search`   | `query`, `filters`, `results_count`, `latency_ms`           | What people are looking for, search quality       |

**Server export and analysis:** Every server supports the same commands as the client — `ic-server analytics export`, `ic-server analytics inspect`, `ic-server analytics clear`. A relay operator troubleshooting laggy matches runs a SQL query against their local `telemetry.db` — no Grafana required. The exported SQLite file can be attached to a bug report or shared with the project team, identical workflow to the client.

**Distributed traces:** A multiplayer game session gets a trace ID (the `correlation` field). Every order, tick, and desync event references this trace ID. Debug a desync by searching for the game's trace ID across the relay's `telemetry.db` and the affected clients' exported `telemetry.db` files — correlate events that crossed component boundaries. For operators with OTEL enabled, the same trace ID routes to Jaeger for visual timeline inspection.

**Health endpoints:** Every server exposes `/healthz` (already designed) and `/readyz`. Prometheus scrape endpoint at `/metrics` (when OTEL export is enabled). These are standard and compose with existing k8s deployment (Helm charts already designed in `03-NETCODE.md`).

### Game Engine Telemetry (Client-Side)

The engine emits structured telemetry for debugging, profiling, and AI training — but only when enabled. **Hot paths remain zero-cost when telemetry is disabled** (compile-time feature flag `telemetry`).

#### Performance Instrumentation

Per-tick system timing, already needed for the benchmark suite (`10-PERFORMANCE.md`), exported as OTEL metrics when enabled:

```
sim.tick.duration_us                  # histogram: total tick time
sim.system.apply_orders_us            # histogram: per-system time
sim.system.production_us
sim.system.harvesting_us
sim.system.movement_us
sim.system.combat_us
sim.system.death_us
sim.system.triggers_us
sim.system.fog_us
sim.entities.total                    # gauge: entity count
sim.entities.by_type                  # gauge: per-component-type count
sim.memory.scratch_bytes              # gauge: TickScratch buffer usage
sim.pathfinding.requests              # counter: pathfinding queries per tick
sim.pathfinding.cache_hits            # counter: flowfield cache reuse
sim.pathfinding.duration_us           # histogram: pathfinding computation time
```

#### Gameplay Event Stream

Structured events emitted during simulation — the raw material for AI training and replay enrichment:

```rust
/// Gameplay events emitted by the sim when telemetry is enabled.
/// These are structured, not printf-style — each field is queryable.
pub enum GameplayEvent {
    UnitCreated { tick: u64, entity: EntityId, unit_type: String, owner: PlayerId },
    UnitDestroyed { tick: u64, entity: EntityId, killer: Option<EntityId>, cause: DeathCause },
    CombatEngagement { tick: u64, attacker: EntityId, target: EntityId, weapon: String, damage: i32, remaining_hp: i32 },
    BuildingPlaced { tick: u64, entity: EntityId, structure_type: String, owner: PlayerId, position: WorldPos },
    HarvestDelivered { tick: u64, harvester: EntityId, resource_type: String, amount: i32, total_credits: i32 },
    OrderIssued { tick: u64, player: PlayerId, order: PlayerOrder, validated: bool, rejection_reason: Option<String> },
    PathfindingCompleted { tick: u64, entity: EntityId, from: WorldPos, to: WorldPos, path_length: u32, compute_time_us: u32 },
    DesyncDetected { tick: u64, expected_hash: u64, actual_hash: u64, player: PlayerId },
    StateSnapshot { tick: u64, state_hash: u64, entity_count: u32 },
}
```

These events are:
- **Emitted as OTEL log records** with structured attributes (not free-text — every field is filterable)
- **Collected locally** into a SQLite gameplay event log alongside replays (D034) — queryable with ad-hoc SQL without an OTEL stack
- **Optionally exported** to a collector for batch analysis (tournament servers, AI training pipelines)

#### State Inspection (Development & Debugging)

A debug overlay (via `bevy_egui`, already in the architecture) that reads live telemetry:

- Per-system tick time breakdown (bar chart)
- Entity count by type
- Network: RTT, order latency, jitter
- Memory: scratch buffer usage, component storage
- Pathfinding: active flowfields, cache hit rate
- Fog: cells updated this tick, stagger bucket
- Sim state hash (for manual desync comparison)

This is the "game engine equivalent of a Kubernetes dashboard" — operators of tournament servers or mod developers can inspect the engine's internal state in real-time.

### AI / LLM Training Data Pipeline

The gameplay event stream is the foundation for AI development:

| Consumer                      | Data Source                        | Purpose                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ic-ai` (skirmish AI)         | Gameplay events from human games   | Learn build orders, engagement timing, micro patterns                     |
| `ic-llm` (missions)           | Gameplay events + enriched replays | Learn what makes missions fun (engagement density, pacing, flow)          |
| `ic-editor` (replay→scenario) | Replay event log (SQLite)          | Direct extraction of waypoints, combat zones, build timelines into editor |
| `ic-llm` (replay→scenario)    | Replay event log + context         | Generate narrative, briefings, dialogue for replay-to-scenario pipeline   |
| Behavioral analysis           | Relay-side player profiles         | APM, reaction time, input entropy → suspicion scoring (V12)               |
| Balance analysis              | Aggregated match outcomes          | Win rates by faction/map/preset → balance tuning                          |
| Adaptive difficulty           | Per-player gameplay patterns       | Build speed, APM, unit composition → difficulty calibration               |
| Community analytics           | Workshop + match metadata          | Popular resources, play patterns, mod adoption → recommendations          |

**Privacy:** Gameplay events are associated with anonymized player IDs (hashed). No PII in telemetry. Players opt in to telemetry export (default: local-only for debugging). Tournament/ranked play may require telemetry for anti-cheat and certified results. See `06-SECURITY.md`.

**Data format:** Gameplay events export as structured OTEL log records → can be collected into Parquet/Arrow columnar format for batch ML training. The LLM training pipeline reads events, not raw replay bytes.

### Product Analytics — Comprehensive Client Event Taxonomy

The telemetry categories above capture what happens *in the simulation* (gameplay events, system timing) and on the *servers* (relay metrics, game lifecycle). A third domain is equally critical: **how players interact with the game itself** — which features are used, which are ignored, how people navigate the UI, how they play matches, and where they get confused or drop off.

This is the data that turns guessing into knowing: "42% of players never opened the career stats page," "players who use control groups average 60% higher APM," "the recovery phrase screen has a 60% skip rate — we should redesign the prompt," "right-click ordering outnumbers sidebar ordering 8:1 — invest in right-click UX, not sidebar polish."

**Core principle: the game client never phones home.** IC is an independent project — the client has zero dependency on any IC-hosted backend, analytics service, or telemetry endpoint. Product analytics are recorded to the local `telemetry.db` (same unified schema as every other component), stored locally, and stay local unless the player deliberately exports them. This matches the project's local-first philosophy (D034, D061) and ensures IC remains fully functional with no internet connectivity whatsoever.

**Design principles:**

1. **Offline-only by design.** The client contains no transmission code, no HTTP endpoints, no phone-home logic. There is no analytics backend to depend on, no infrastructure to maintain, no service to go offline.
2. **Player-owned data.** The `telemetry.db` file lives on the player's machine — the same open SQLite format they can query themselves (D034). It's their data. They can inspect it, export it, or delete it anytime.
3. **Voluntary export for bug reports.** `/analytics export` produces a self-contained file (JSON or SQLite extract) the player can review and attach to bug reports, forum posts, GitHub issues, or community surveys. The player decides when, where, and to whom they send it.
4. **Transparent and inspectable.** `/analytics inspect` shows exactly what's recorded. No hidden fields, no device fingerprinting. Players can query the SQLite table directly.
5. **Zero impact.** The game is fully functional with analytics recording on or off. No nag screens. Recording can be disabled via `telemetry.product_analytics` cvar (default: on for local recording).

**What product analytics explicitly does NOT capture:**
- Chat messages, player names, opponent names (no PII)
- Keystroke logging, raw mouse coordinates, screen captures
- Hardware identifiers, MAC addresses, IP addresses
- Filesystem contents, installed software, browser history

#### GUI Interaction Events

These events capture how the player navigates the interface — which screens they visit, which buttons they click, which features they discover, and where they spend their time. This is the primary source for UX insights.

| Event                  | JSON `data` Fields                                                                  | What It Reveals                                                          |

#### RTS Input Events

These events capture how the player actually plays the game — selection patterns, ordering habits, control group usage, camera behavior. This is the primary source for gameplay pattern analysis and understanding how players interact with the core RTS mechanics.

| Event               | JSON `data` Fields                                                                                                                                                                 | What It Reveals                                                                                            |

#### Match Flow Events

These capture the lifecycle and pacing of matches — when they start, how they progress, why they end. The `match.pace` snapshot emitted periodically is particularly powerful: it creates a time-series of the player's economic and military state, enabling pace analysis, build order reconstruction, and difficulty curve assessment.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session.start`          | `engine_version`, `os`, `display_resolution`, `game_module`, `mod_profile_fingerprint`, `session_number` (incrementing per install)                    | Environment context — OS distribution, screen sizes, how many times they've launched                  |
| `session.mod_manifest`   | `game_module`, `mod_profile_fingerprint`, `unit_types[]`, `building_types[]`, `weapon_types[]`, `resource_types[]`, `faction_names[]`, `mod_sources[]` | Self-describing type vocabulary — makes exported telemetry interpretable without the mod's YAML files |
| `session.profile_switch` | `old_fingerprint`, `new_fingerprint`, `old_game_module`, `new_game_module`, `profile_name`                                                             | Mid-session mod profile changes — boundary marker for analytics segmentation                          |
| `session.end`            | `duration_s`, `reason` (quit/crash/update/system_sleep), `screens_visited[]`, `matches_played`, `features_used[]`                                      | Session shape — how long, what did they do, clean exit or crash?                                      |
| `session.idle`           | `screen_id`, `duration_s`                                                                                                                              | Idle detection — was the player AFK on the main menu for 20 minutes?                                  |

**`session.mod_manifest` rationale:** When telemetry records `unit_type: "HARV"` or `weapon: "Vulcan"`, these strings are meaningful only if you know the mod's type catalog. Without context, exported `telemetry.db` files require the original mod's YAML files to interpret event payloads. The `session.mod_manifest` event, emitted once per session (and again on `session.profile_switch`), captures the active mod's full type vocabulary — every unit, building, weapon, resource, and faction name defined in the loaded YAML rules. This makes exported telemetry **self-describing**: an analyst receiving a community-submitted `telemetry.db` can identify what `"HARV"` means without installing the mod. The manifest is typically 2–10 KB of JSON — negligible overhead for one event per session.

#### Performance Sampling Events

Emitted periodically (not every frame — sampled to avoid overhead). These answer: "Are players hitting performance problems we don't see in development?"

| Event              | JSON `data` Fields                                                                   | Sampling Rate | What It Reveals                                                  |

### Analytical Power: What Questions the Data Answers

The telemetry design above is intentionally structured for SQL queryability. Here are representative queries against the unified `telemetry_events` table that demonstrate the kind of insights this data enables — these queries work identically on client exports, server `telemetry.db` files, or aggregated community datasets:

**GUI & UX Insights:**

```sql
-- Which screens do players never visit?
SELECT json_extract(data, '$.screen_id') AS screen, COUNT(*) AS visits
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'gui.screen.open'
GROUP BY screen ORDER BY visits ASC LIMIT 20;

-- How do players issue orders: right-click, hotkey, or sidebar?
SELECT json_extract(data, '$.method') AS method, COUNT(*) AS orders
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'input.order'
GROUP BY method ORDER BY orders DESC;

-- Which settings do players change within the first session?
SELECT json_extract(data, '$.setting_path') AS setting,
       json_extract(data, '$.old_value') AS default_val,
       json_extract(data, '$.new_value') AS changed_to,
       COUNT(*) AS changes
FROM telemetry_events e
JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT session_id FROM telemetry_events
      WHERE event = 'session.start'
      AND json_extract(data, '$.session_number') = 1) first
  ON e.session_id = first.session_id
WHERE e.event = 'settings.changed'
GROUP BY setting ORDER BY changes DESC;

-- Control group adoption: what percentage of matches use ctrl groups?
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN event = 'input.ctrl_group' THEN session_id END) * 100.0 /
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN event = 'match.start' THEN session_id END) AS pct_matches_with_ctrl_groups
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event IN ('input.ctrl_group', 'match.start');
```

**Gameplay Pattern Insights:**

```sql
-- Average match duration by mode and map
SELECT json_extract(data, '$.mode') AS mode,
       json_extract(data, '$.map') AS map,
       AVG(json_extract(data, '$.duration_s')) AS avg_duration_s,
       COUNT(*) AS matches
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'match.end'
GROUP BY mode, map ORDER BY matches DESC;

-- Build order openings: what do players build first?
SELECT json_extract(data, '$.structure_type') AS first_building,
       COUNT(*) AS frequency,
       AVG(json_extract(data, '$.time_s')) AS avg_time_s
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'match.first_build'
GROUP BY first_building ORDER BY frequency DESC;

-- APM distribution across the player base
SELECT
  CASE WHEN apm < 30 THEN 'casual (<30)'
       WHEN apm < 80 THEN 'intermediate (30-80)'
       WHEN apm < 150 THEN 'advanced (80-150)'
       ELSE 'expert (150+)' END AS skill_bucket,
  COUNT(*) AS snapshots
FROM (SELECT CAST(json_extract(data, '$.apm') AS INTEGER) AS apm
      FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'match.pace')
GROUP BY skill_bucket;

-- At what deficit do players surrender?
SELECT AVG(json_extract(data, '$.army_value_ratio')) AS avg_army_ratio,
       AVG(json_extract(data, '$.credits_diff')) AS avg_credit_diff,
       COUNT(*) AS surrenders
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'match.surrender_point';
```

**Troubleshooting Insights:**

```sql
-- Crash frequency by context (which screen/system crashes most?)
SELECT json_extract(data, '$.context') AS context,
       json_extract(data, '$.backtrace_hash') AS stack,
       COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'error.crash'
GROUP BY context, stack ORDER BY occurrences DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Desync correlation: which maps/mods trigger desyncs?
-- (run across aggregated relay + client exports)
SELECT json_extract(data, '$.map') AS map,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN event = 'relay.desync' THEN 1 END) AS desyncs,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN event = 'relay.game.end' THEN 1 END) AS total_games,
       ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN event = 'relay.desync' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 /
             NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN event = 'relay.game.end' THEN 1 END), 0), 1) AS desync_pct
FROM telemetry_events
WHERE event IN ('relay.desync', 'relay.game.end')
GROUP BY map ORDER BY desync_pct DESC;

-- Performance: which players have sustained frame drops?
SELECT session_id,
       AVG(json_extract(data, '$.p95_ms')) AS avg_p95_frame_ms,
       MAX(json_extract(data, '$.entity_count')) AS peak_entities
FROM telemetry_events WHERE event = 'perf.frame'
GROUP BY session_id
HAVING avg_p95_frame_ms > 33.3  -- below 30 FPS sustained
ORDER BY avg_p95_frame_ms DESC;
```

**Aggregation happens in the open, not in a backend.** If the project team wants to analyze telemetry across many players (e.g., for a usability study, balance patch, or release retrospective), they ask the community to voluntarily submit exports — the same model as open-source projects collecting crash dumps on GitHub. Community members run `/analytics export`, review the file, and attach it. Aggregation scripts live in the repository and run locally — anyone can reproduce the analysis.

**Console commands (D058) — identical on client and server:**

| Command                                                        | Action                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/analytics status`                                            | Show recording status, event count, `telemetry.db` size, retention settings       |
| `/analytics inspect [category] [--last N]`                     | Display recent events, optionally filtered by category                            |
| `/analytics export [--from DATE] [--to DATE] [--category CAT]` | Export to JSON/SQLite in `<data_dir>/exports/` with optional date/category filter |
| `/analytics clear [--before DATE]`                             | Delete events, optionally only before a date                                      |
| `/analytics on/off`                                            | Toggle local recording (`telemetry.product_analytics` cvar)                       |
| `/analytics query SQL`                                         | Run ad-hoc SQL against `telemetry.db` (dev console only, `DEV_ONLY` flag)         |

### Architecture: Where Telemetry Lives

**Primary path (always-on): local SQLite.** Every component writes to its own `telemetry.db`. This is the ground truth. No network, no infrastructure, no dependencies.

```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Every component (client, relay, tracking, workshop)             │
  │                                                                 │
  │  Instrumentation    ──►  telemetry.db (local SQLite)            │
  │  (tracing + events)      ├── always written                     │
  │                          ├── /analytics inspect                 │
  │                          ├── /analytics export ──► .json file   │
  │                          │   (voluntary: bug report, feedback)  │
  │                          └── retention: max size / max age      │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Optional path (server operators only): OTEL export.** Server operators who want real-time dashboards can enable OTEL export alongside the SQLite sink. This is a deployment choice for sophisticated operators — never a requirement.

```
  Servers with OTEL enabled:

  telemetry.db ◄── Instrumentation ──► OTEL Collector (optional)
  (always)         (tracing + events)       │
                                     ┌──────┴──────────────────┐

                              ┌──────▼──┐ ┌────▼────┐ ┌───────▼───┐

                                                             │
                                                      ┌──────▼──────┐
                                                      │ AI Training  │
                                                      │ (Parquet→ML) │
                                                      └─────────────┘
```

The dual-write approach means:
- **Every deployment** gets full telemetry in SQLite — zero setup required
- **Sophisticated deployments** can additionally route to Grafana/Prometheus/Jaeger for real-time dashboards
- Self-hosters can route OTEL to whatever they want (Grafana Cloud, Datadog, or just stdout)
- If the OTEL collector goes down, telemetry continues in SQLite uninterrupted — no data loss

### Implementation Approach

**Rust ecosystem:**
- `tracing` crate — Bevy already uses this; add structured fields and span instrumentation
- `opentelemetry` + `opentelemetry-otlp` crates — OTEL SDK for Rust
- `tracing-opentelemetry` — bridges `tracing` spans to OTEL traces
- `metrics` crate — lightweight counters/histograms, exported via OTEL

**Zero-cost engine instrumentation when disabled:** The `telemetry` feature flag gates **engine-level** instrumentation (per-system tick timing, `GameplayEvent` stream, OTEL export) behind `#[cfg(feature = "telemetry")]`. When disabled, all engine telemetry calls compile to no-ops. No runtime cost, no allocations, no branches. This respects invariant #5 (efficiency-first performance).

**Product analytics (GUI interaction, session, settings, onboarding, errors, perf sampling) always record to SQLite** — they are lightweight structured event inserts, not per-tick instrumentation. The overhead is negligible (one SQLite INSERT per user action, batched in WAL mode). Players who want to disable even this can set `telemetry.product_analytics false`.

**Transaction batching:** All SQLite INSERTs — both telemetry events and gameplay events — are explicitly batched in transactions to avoid per-INSERT fsync overhead:

| Event source      | Batch strategy                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product analytics | Buffered in memory; flushed in a single `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` every 1 second or 50 events, whichever first   |
| Gameplay events   | Buffered per tick; flushed in a single `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` at end of tick (typically 1-20 events per tick) |
| Server telemetry  | Ring buffer; flushed in a single `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` every 100 ms or 200 events, whichever first           |

All writes happen on a dedicated I/O thread (or `spawn_blocking` task) — never on the game loop thread. The game loop thread only appends to a lock-free ring buffer; the I/O thread drains and commits. This guarantees that SQLite contention (including `busy_timeout` waits and WAL checkpoints) cannot cause frame drops.

**Ring buffer sizing:** The ring buffer must absorb all events generated during the worst-case I/O thread stall (WAL checkpoint on HDD: 200–500 ms). At peak event rates (~600 events/s during intense combat — gameplay events + telemetry + product analytics combined), a 500 ms stall generates ~300 events. **Minimum ring buffer capacity: 1024 entries** (3.4× headroom over worst-case). Each entry is a lightweight enum (~64–128 bytes), so the buffer occupies ~64–128 KB — negligible. If the buffer fills despite this sizing, events are dropped with a counter increment (same pattern as the replay writer's `frames_lost` tracking in V45). The I/O thread logs a warning on drain if drops occurred. This is a last-resort safety net, not an expected operating condition.

**Build configurations:**
| Build               | Engine Telemetry | Product Analytics (SQLite) | OTEL Export | Use case                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `release`           | Off              | On (local SQLite)          | Off         | Player-facing builds — minimal overhead    |
| `release-telemetry` | On               | On (local SQLite)          | Optional    | Tournament servers, AI training, debugging |
| `debug`             | On               | On (local SQLite)          | Optional    | Development — full instrumentation         |

### Self-Hosting Observability

Community server operators get observability for free. The docker-compose.yaml (already designed in `03-NETCODE.md`) can optionally include a Grafana + Prometheus + Loki stack:

```yaml
# docker-compose.observability.yaml (optional overlay)
services:
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest
    ports:
      - "4317:4317"    # OTLP gRPC
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"    # dashboards
  loki:
    image: grafana/loki:latest
```

Pre-built Grafana dashboards ship with the project:
- **Relay Dashboard:** active games, player RTT, orders/sec, desync events, suspicion scores
- **Tracking Dashboard:** listings, heartbeats, query rates
- **Workshop Dashboard:** downloads, publishes, dependency resolution times
- **Engine Dashboard:** tick times, entity counts, system breakdown, pathfinding stats

**Alternatives considered:**
- Custom metrics format (less work initially, but no ecosystem — no Grafana, no alerting, no community tooling)
- StatsD (simpler but metrics-only — no traces, no structured logs, no distributed correlation)
- No telemetry (leaves operators blind and AI training without data)
- Always-on telemetry (violates performance invariant — must be zero-cost when disabled)

**Phase:** Unified `telemetry_events` SQLite schema + `/analytics` console commands in Phase 2 (shared across all components from day one). Engine telemetry (per-system timing, `GameplayEvent` stream) in Phase 2 (sim). Product analytics (GUI interaction, session, settings, onboarding, errors, performance sampling) in Phase 3 (alongside UI chrome). Server-side SQLite telemetry recording (relay, tracking, workshop) in Phase 5 (multiplayer). Optional OTEL export layer for server operators in Phase 5. Pre-built Grafana dashboards in Phase 5. AI training pipeline in Phase 7 (LLM).

## D032: Switchable UI Themes (Main Menu, Chrome, Lobby)

**Decision:** Ship a YAML-driven UI theme system with multiple built-in presets. Players pick their preferred visual style for the main menu, in-game chrome (sidebar, minimap, build queue), and lobby. Mods and community can create and publish custom themes.

**Motivation:**

The Remastered Collection nailed its main menu — it respects the original Red Alert's military aesthetic while modernizing the presentation. OpenRA went a completely different direction: functional, data-driven, but with a generic feel that doesn't evoke the same nostalgia. Both approaches have merit for different audiences. Rather than pick one style, let the player choose.

This also mirrors D019 (switchable balance presets) and D048 (switchable render modes). Just as players choose between Classic, OpenRA, and Remastered balance rules in the lobby, and toggle between classic and HD graphics with F1, they should be able to choose their UI chrome the same way. All three compose into experience profiles.

**Built-in themes (original art, not copied assets):**

| Theme      | Inspired By                  | Aesthetic                                                                                                                               | Default For      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Classic    | Original RA1 (1996)          | Military minimalism — bare buttons over a static title screen, Soviet-era propaganda palette, utilitarian layout, Hell March on startup | RA1 game module  |
| Remastered | Remastered Collection (2020) | Clean modern military — HD polish, sleek panels, reverent to the original but refined, jukebox integration                              | —                |
| Modern     | Iron Curtain's own design    | Full Bevy UI capabilities — dynamic panels, animated transitions, modern game launcher feel                                             | New game modules |

**Important legal note:** All theme art assets are **original creations** inspired by these design languages — no assets are copied from EA's Remastered Collection (those are proprietary) or from OpenRA. The themes capture the *aesthetic philosophy* (palette, layout structure, design mood) but use entirely IC-created sprite sheets, fonts, and layouts. This is standard "inspired by" in game development — layout and color choices are not copyrightable, only specific artistic expression is.

**Theme structure (YAML-defined):**

```yaml
# themes/classic.yaml
theme:
  name: Classic
  description: "Inspired by the original Red Alert — military minimalism"

**Shellmap system (live menu backgrounds):**

Like OpenRA's signature feature — a real game map with scripted AI battles running behind the main menu. But better:

- **Per-theme shellmaps.** Each theme can specify its own shellmap, or none (Classic theme faithfully uses a static image).
- **Multiple shellmaps with random selection.** The Remastered and Modern themes can ship with several shellmaps — a random one plays each launch.
- **Shellmaps are regular maps** tagged with `visibility: shellmap` in YAML. The engine loads them with a scripted AI that stages dramatic battles. Mods automatically get their own shellmaps.
- **Orbiting/panning camera.** Shellmaps can define camera paths — slow pan across a battlefield, orbiting around a base, or fixed view.

**Shellmap AI design:** Shellmaps use a dedicated AI profile (`shellmap_ai` in `ic-ai`) optimized for visual drama, not competitive play:

```yaml
# ai/shellmap.yaml
shellmap_ai:
  personality:
    name: "Shellmap Director"
    aggression: 40               # builds up before attacking
    attack_threshold: 5000       # large armies before engaging
    micro_level: basic
    tech_preference: balanced    # diverse unit mix for visual variety
    dramatic_mode: true          # avoids cheese, prefers spectacle
    max_tick_budget_us: 2000     # 2ms max — shellmap is background
    unit_variety_bonus: 0.5      # AI prefers building different unit types
    no_early_rush: true          # let both sides build up
```

The `dramatic_mode` flag tells the AI to prioritize visually interesting behavior: large mixed-army clashes over efficient rush strategies, diverse unit compositions over optimal builds, and sustained back-and-forth engagements over quick victories. The AI's tick budget is capped at 2ms to avoid impacting menu UI responsiveness. Shellmap AI is the same `ic-ai` system used for skirmish — just a different personality profile.

**Per-game-module default themes:**

Each game module registers its own default theme that matches its aesthetic:
- **RA1 module:** Classic theme (red/black Soviet palette)
- **TD module:** GDI theme (green/black Nod palette) — community or first-party
- **RA2 module:** Remastered-style with RA2 color palette — community or first-party

The game module provides a `default_theme()` in its `GameModule` trait implementation. Players override this in settings.

**Integration with existing UI architecture:**

The theme system layers on top of `ic-ui`'s existing responsive layout profiles (D002, `02-ARCHITECTURE.md`):
- **Layout profiles** handle *where* UI elements go (sidebar vs bottom bar, phone vs desktop) — driven by `ScreenClass`
- **Themes** handle *how* UI elements look (colors, chrome sprites, fonts, animations) — driven by player preference
- Orthogonal concerns. A player on mobile gets the Phone layout profile + their chosen theme. A player on desktop gets the Desktop layout profile + their chosen theme.

**Community themes:**

- Themes are Tier 1 mods (YAML + sprite sheets) — no code required
- Publishable to the workshop (D030) as a standalone resource
- Players subscribe to themes independently of gameplay mods — themes and gameplay mods stack
- An "OpenRA-inspired" theme would be a natural community contribution
- Total conversion mod developers create matching themes for their mods

**What this enables:**
1. **Day-one nostalgia choice.** First launch asks: do you want Classic, Remastered, or Modern? Sets the mood immediately.
2. **Mod-matched chrome.** A WWII mod ships its own olive-drab theme. A sci-fi mod ships neon blue chrome. The theme changes with the mod.
3. **Cross-view consistency with D019.** Classic balance + Classic theme = feels like 1996. Remastered balance + Remastered theme = feels like 2020. Players configure the full experience.
4. **Live backgrounds without code.** Shellmaps are regular maps — anyone can create one with the map editor.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Hardcoded single theme (OpenRA approach) — forces one aesthetic on everyone; misses the emotional connection different players have to different eras of C&C
- Copy Remastered Collection assets — illegal; proprietary EA art
- CSS-style theming (web-engine approach) — overengineered for a game; YAML is simpler and Bevy-native
- Theme as a full WASM mod — overkill; theming is data, not behavior; Tier 1 YAML is sufficient

**Phase:** Phase 3 (Game Chrome). Theme system is part of the `ic-ui` crate. Built-in themes ship with the engine. Community themes available in Phase 6a (Workshop).

## D033: Toggleable QoL & Gameplay Behavior Presets

**Decision:** Every UX and gameplay behavior improvement added by OpenRA or the Remastered Collection over vanilla Red Alert is individually toggleable. Built-in presets group these toggles into coherent experience profiles. Players can pick a preset and then customize any individual toggle. In multiplayer lobbies, sim-affecting toggles are shared settings; client-only toggles are per-player.

**The problem this solves:**

OpenRA and the Remastered Collection each introduced dozens of quality-of-life improvements over the original 1996 Red Alert. Many are genuinely excellent (attack-move, waypoint queuing, multi-queue production). But some players want the authentic vanilla experience. Others want the full OpenRA feature set. Others want the Remastered Collection's specific subset. And some want to cherry-pick: "Give me OpenRA's attack-move but not its build radius circles."

Currently, no Red Alert implementation lets you do this. OpenRA's QoL features are hardcoded. The Remastered Collection's are hardcoded. Vanilla's limitations are hardcoded. Every version forces you into one developer's opinion of what the game "should" feel like.

**Our approach:** Every QoL feature is a YAML-configurable toggle. Presets set all toggles at once. Individual toggles override the preset. The player owns their experience.

### QoL Feature Catalog

Every toggle is categorized as **sim-affecting** (changes game logic — must be identical for all players in multiplayer) or **client-only** (visual/UX — each player can set independently).

### Experience Presets

Presets set all toggles at once. The player selects a preset, then overrides individual toggles if they want.

| Preset                     | Balance (D019) | Theme (D032) | QoL (D033)     | Feel                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Vanilla RA**             | `classic`      | `classic`    | `vanilla`      | Authentic 1996 experience — warts and all |
| **OpenRA**                 | `openra`       | `modern`     | `openra`       | Full OpenRA experience                    |
| **Remastered**             | `remastered`   | `remastered` | `remastered`   | Remastered Collection feel                |
| **Iron Curtain** (default) | `classic`      | `modern`     | `iron_curtain` | Classic balance + best QoL from all eras  |
| **Custom**                 | any            | any          | any            | Player picks everything                   |

The "Iron Curtain" default cherry-picks: classic balance (units feel iconic), modern theme (polished UI), and the best QoL features from both OpenRA and Remastered (attack-move, multi-queue, health bars, range circles — everything that makes the game more playable without changing game feel).

### Sim vs Client Split

Critical for multiplayer: some toggles change game rules, others are purely cosmetic.

**Sim-affecting toggles** (lobby settings — all players must agree):
- Everything in `production`, `commands`, and `gameplay` sections
- These are validated deterministically by the sim (invariant #1)
- Multiplayer lobby: host sets the QoL preset; displayed to all players before match start
- Mismatch = connection refused (enforced by sim hash, same as balance presets)

**Client-only toggles** (per-player preferences — each player sets their own):
- Everything in `ui_feedback` and `selection` sections
- One player can play with always-visible health bars while their opponent plays with none
- Stored in player settings, not in the lobby configuration
- No sim impact — purely visual/UX

### Interaction with Other Systems

**D019 (Balance Presets):** QoL presets and balance presets are independent axes. You can play with `classic` balance + `openra` QoL, or `openra` balance + `vanilla` QoL. The lobby UI shows both selections.

**D032 (UI Themes):** QoL and themes are also independent. The "Classic" theme changes chrome appearance; the "Vanilla" QoL preset changes gameplay behavior. They're separate settings that happen to compose well.

**Experience Profiles:** The meta-layer above all of these. Selecting "Vanilla RA" experience profile sets D019=classic, D032=classic, D033=vanilla, D043=classic-ra, D045=classic-ra, D048=classic in one click. Selecting "Iron Curtain" sets D019=classic, D032=modern, D033=iron_curtain, D043=ic-default, D045=ic-default, D048=hd. After selecting a profile, any individual setting can still be overridden.

**Modding (Tier 1):** QoL presets are just YAML files in `presets/qol/`. Modders can create custom QoL presets — a total conversion mod ships its own preset tuned for its gameplay. The `mod.yaml` manifest can specify a default QoL preset.

### Rationale

- **Respect for all eras.** Each version of Red Alert — original, OpenRA, Remastered — has a community that loves it. Forcing one set of behaviors on everyone loses part of the audience.
- **Player agency.** "Good defaults with full customization" is the guiding principle. The IC default enables the best QoL features; purists can turn them off; power users can cherry-pick.
- **Zero engine complexity.** QoL toggles are just config flags read by systems that already exist. Attack-move is either registered as a command or not. Health bars are either rendered or not. No complex runtime switching — the config is read once at game start.
- **Multiplayer safety.** The sim/client split ensures determinism. Sim-affecting toggles are lobby settings (like game speed or starting cash). Client-only toggles are personal preferences (like enabling subtitles in any other game).
- **Natural extension of D019 + D032.** Balance, theme, and behavior are three independent axes of experience customization. Together they let a player fully configure what "Red Alert" feels like to them.

### UX Principle: No Dead-End Buttons

**Never grey out or disable a button without telling the player why and how to fix it.** A greyed-out button is a dead end — the player sees a feature exists, knows they can't use it, and has no idea what to do about it. This is a universal UX anti-pattern.

IC's rule: **every button is always clickable.** If a feature requires something the player hasn't configured, clicking the button opens an **inline guidance panel** that:

1. **Explains what's needed** — a short, plain-language sentence (not a generic "feature unavailable")
2. **Offers a direct link** to the relevant settings/configuration screen
3. **Returns the player** to where they were after configuration, so they can continue seamlessly

**Examples across the engine:**

| Button Clicked                    | Missing Prerequisite           | Guidance Panel Shows                                                                                                                                                        |

This principle applies to **every UI surface** — game menus, SDK tools, lobby, settings, Workshop browser. No exceptions. The guidance panel is a lightweight overlay (not a modal dialog that blocks interaction), styled to match the active UI theme (D032), and dismissible with Escape or clicking outside.

**Why this matters:**
- Players discover features by clicking things. A greyed-out button teaches them "this doesn't work" and they may never try again. A guidance panel teaches them "this works if you do X" and gets them there in one click.
- Reduces support questions. Instead of "why is this button grey," the UI answers the question before it's asked.
- Respects player intelligence. The player clicked the button because they wanted the feature — help them get it, don't just say no.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Hardcode one set of behaviors (rejected — this is what every other implementation does; we can do better)
- Make QoL features mod-only (rejected — too important to bury behind modding; should be one click in settings, same as D019)
- Only offer presets without individual toggles (rejected — power users need granular control; presets are starting points, not cages)
- Bundle QoL into balance presets (rejected — "I want OpenRA's attack-move but classic unit values" is a legitimate preference; conflating balance with UX is a design mistake)

**Phase:** Phase 3 (alongside D032 UI themes and sidebar work). QoL toggles are implemented as system-level config flags — each system checks its toggle on initialization. Preset YAML files are authored during Phase 2 (simulation) as features are built.

## D034: SQLite as Embedded Storage for Services and Client

**Decision:** Use SQLite (via `rusqlite`) as the embedded database for all backend services that need persistent state and for the game client's local metadata indices. No external database dependency required for any deployment.

**What this means:** Every service that persists data beyond a single process lifetime uses an embedded SQLite database file. The "just a binary" philosophy (see `03-NETCODE.md` § Backend Infrastructure) is preserved — an operator downloads a binary, runs it, and persistence is a `.db` file next to the executable. No PostgreSQL, no MySQL, no managed database service.

**Where SQLite is used:**

### Backend Services

| Service                | What it stores                                                                                                              | Why not in-memory                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Relay server**       | `CertifiedMatchResult` records, `DesyncReport` events, `PlayerBehaviorProfile` history, replay archive metadata             | Match results and behavioral data are valuable beyond the game session — operators need to query desync patterns, review suspicion scores, link replays to match records. A relay restart shouldn't erase match history. |
| **Workshop server**    | Resource metadata, versions, dependencies, download counts, ratings, search index (FTS5), license data, replication cursors | This is a package registry — functionally equivalent to crates.io's data layer. Search, dependency resolution, and version queries are relational workloads.                                                             |
| **Matchmaking server** | Player ratings (Glicko-2), match history, seasonal league data, leaderboards                                                | Ratings and match history must survive restarts. Leaderboard queries (`top N`, per-faction, per-map) are natural SQL.                                                                                                    |
| **Tournament server**  | Brackets, match results, map pool votes, community reports                                                                  | Tournament state spans hours/days; must survive restarts. Bracket queries and result reporting are relational.                                                                                                           |

### Game Client (local)

| Data                   | What it stores                                                                   | Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Replay catalog**     | Player names, map, factions, date, duration, result, file path, signature status | Browse and search local replays without scanning files on disk. Filter by map, opponent, date range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Save game index**    | Save name, campaign, mission, timestamp, playtime, thumbnail path                | Fast save browser without deserializing every save file on launch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Workshop cache**     | Downloaded resource metadata, versions, checksums, dependency graph              | Offline dependency resolution. Know what's installed without scanning the filesystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Map catalog**        | Map name, player count, size, author, source (local/workshop/OpenRA), tags       | Browse local maps from all sources with a single query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Gameplay event log** | Structured `GameplayEvent` records (D031) per game session                       | Queryable post-game analysis without an OTEL stack. Frequently-aggregated fields (`event_type`, `unit_type_id`, `target_type_id`) are denormalized as indexed columns for fast `PlayerStyleProfile` building (D042). Full payloads remain in `data_json` for ad-hoc SQL: `SELECT json_extract(data_json, '$.weapon'), AVG(json_extract(data_json, '$.damage')) FROM gameplay_events WHERE event_type = 'combat' AND session_id = ?`. |
| **Asset index**        | `.mix` archive contents, MiniYAML conversion cache (keyed by file hash)          | Skip re-parsing on startup. Know which `.mix` contains which file without opening every archive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Where SQLite is NOT used

| Area                | Why not                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`ic-sim`**        | No I/O in the sim. Ever. Invariant #1.                                                                                                                 |
| **Tracking server** | Truly ephemeral data — game listings with TTL. In-memory is correct.                                                                                   |
| **Hot paths**       | No DB queries per tick. All SQLite access is at load time, between games, or on UI/background threads.                                                 |
| **Save game data**  | Save files are serde-serialized sim snapshots loaded as a whole unit. No partial queries needed. SQLite indexes their *metadata*, not their *content*. |
| **Campaign state**  | Loaded/saved as a unit inside save games. Fits in memory. No relational queries.                                                                       |

### Why SQLite specifically

**The strategic argument: SQLite is the world's most widely deployed database format.** Choosing SQLite means IC's player data isn't locked behind a proprietary format that only IC can read — it's stored in an open, standardized, universally-supported container that anything can query. Python scripts, R notebooks, Jupyter, Grafana, Excel (via ODBC), DB Browser for SQLite, the `sqlite3` CLI, Datasette, LLM agents, custom analytics tools, research projects, community stat trackers, third-party companion apps — all of them can open an IC `.db` file and run SQL against it with zero IC-specific tooling. This is a deliberate architectural choice: **player data is a platform, not a product feature.** The community can build things on top of IC's data that we never imagined, using tools we've never heard of, because the interface is SQL — not a custom binary format, not a REST API that requires our servers to be running, not a proprietary export.

Every use case the community might invent — balance analysis, AI training datasets, tournament statistics, replay research, performance benchmarking, meta-game tracking, coach feedback tools, stream overlays reading live stat data — is a SQL query away. No SDK required. No reverse engineering. No waiting for us to build an export feature. The `.db` file IS the export.

This is also why SQLite is chosen over flat files (JSON, CSV): structured data in a relational schema with SQL query support enables questions that flat files can't answer efficiently. "What's my win rate with Soviet on maps larger than 128×128 against players I've faced more than 3 times?" is a single SQL query against `matches` + `match_players`. With JSON files, it's a custom script.

**The practical arguments:**

- **`rusqlite`** is a mature, well-maintained Rust crate with no unsafe surprises
- **Single-file database** — fits the "just a binary" deployment model. No connection strings, no separate database process, no credentials to manage
- **Self-hosting alignment** — a community relay operator on a €5 VPS gets persistent match history without installing or operating a database server
- **FTS5 full-text search** — covers workshop resource search and replay text search without Elasticsearch or a separate search service
- **WAL mode** — handles concurrent reads from web endpoints while a single writer persists new records. Sufficient for community-scale deployments (hundreds of concurrent users, not millions)
- **WASM-compatible** — `sql.js` (Emscripten build of SQLite) or `sqlite-wasm` for the browser target. The client-side replay catalog and gameplay event log work in the browser build
- **Ad-hoc investigation** — any operator can open the `.db` file in DB Browser for SQLite, DBeaver, or the `sqlite3` CLI and run queries immediately. No Grafana dashboards required. This fills the gap between "just stdout logs" and "full OTEL stack" for community self-hosters
- **Backup-friendly** — `VACUUM INTO` produces a self-contained, compacted copy safe to take while the database is in use (D061). A backup is just a file copy. No dump/restore ceremony
- **Immune to bitrot** — The Library of Congress recommends SQLite as a storage format for datasets. IC player data from 2027 will still be readable in 2047 — the format is that stable
- **Deterministic and testable** — in CI, gameplay event assertions are SQL queries against a test fixture database. No mock infrastructure needed

### Relationship to D031 (OTEL Telemetry)

D031 (OTEL) and D034 (SQLite) are complementary, not competing:

| Concern                   | D031 (OTEL)                                  | D034 (SQLite)                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-time monitoring**  | Yes — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards | No                                                                     |
| **Distributed tracing**   | Yes — Jaeger traces across clients and relay | No                                                                     |
| **Persistent records**    | No — metrics are time-windowed, logs rotate  | Yes — match history, ratings, replays are permanent                    |
| **Ad-hoc investigation**  | Requires OTEL stack running                  | Just open the `.db` file                                               |
| **Offline operation**     | No — needs collector + backends              | Yes — works standalone                                                 |
| **Client-side debugging** | Requires exporting to a collector            | Local `.db` file, queryable immediately                                |
| **AI training pipeline**  | Yes — Parquet/Arrow export for ML            | Source data — gameplay events could be exported from SQLite to Parquet |

OTEL is for operational monitoring and distributed debugging. SQLite is for persistent records, metadata indices, and standalone investigation. Tournament servers and relay servers use both — OTEL for dashboards, SQLite for match history.

### Consumers of Player Data

SQLite isn't just infrastructure — it's a UX pillar. Multiple crates read the client-side database to deliver features no other RTS offers:

| Consumer                         | Crate             | What it reads                                                                          | What it produces                                                                                                  | Required?                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Player-facing analytics**      | `ic-ui`           | `gameplay_events`, `matches`, `match_players`, `campaign_missions`, `roster_snapshots` | Post-game stats screen, career stats page, campaign dashboard with roster/veterancy graphs, mod balance dashboard | Always on                                                 |

Player analytics, adaptive AI, player style profiles, and the training system are always available. LLM personalization and coaching activate only when the player has configured an LLM provider — the game is fully functional without it.

All consumers are read-only. The sim writes nothing (invariant #1) — `gameplay_events` are recorded by a Bevy observer system outside `ic-sim`, and `matches`/`campaign_missions` are written at session boundaries.

### Player-Facing Analytics (`ic-ui`)

No other RTS surfaces your own match data this way. SQLite makes it trivial — queries run on a background thread, results drive a lightweight chart component in `ic-ui` (Bevy 2D: line, bar, pie, heatmap, stacked area).

**Post-game stats screen** (after every match):
- Unit production timeline (stacked area: units built per minute by type)
- Resource income/expenditure curves
- Combat engagement heatmap (where fights happened on the map)
- APM over time, army value graph, tech tree timing
- Head-to-head comparison table vs opponent
- All data: `SELECT ... FROM gameplay_events WHERE session_id = ?`

**Career stats page** (main menu):
- Win rate by faction, map, opponent, game mode — over time and lifetime
- Rating history graph (Glicko-2 from matchmaking, synced to local DB)
- Most-used units, highest kill-count units, signature strategies
- Session history: date, map, opponent, result, duration — clickable → replay
- All data: `SELECT ... FROM matches JOIN match_players ...`

**Campaign dashboard** (D021 integration):
- Roster composition graph per mission (how your army evolves across the campaign)
- Veterancy progression: track named units across missions (the tank that survived from mission 1)
- Campaign path visualization: which branches you took, which missions you replayed
- Performance trends: completion time, casualties, resource efficiency per mission
- All data: `SELECT ... FROM campaign_missions JOIN roster_snapshots ...`

**Mod balance dashboard** (Phase 7, for mod developers):
- Unit win-rate contribution, cost-efficiency scatter plots, engagement outcome distributions
- Compare across balance presets (D019) or mod versions
- `ic mod stats` CLI command reads the same SQLite database
- All data: `SELECT ... FROM gameplay_events WHERE mod_id = ?`

### LLM Personalization (`ic-llm`) — Optional, BYOLLM

When a player has configured an LLM provider (see BYOLLM in D016), `ic-llm` reads the local SQLite database (read-only) and injects player context into generation prompts. This is entirely optional — every game feature works without it. No data leaves the device unless the user's chosen LLM provider is cloud-based.

**Personalized mission generation:**
- "You've been playing Soviet heavy armor for 12 games. Here's a mission that forces infantry-first tactics."
- "Your win rate drops against Allied naval. This coastal defense mission trains that weakness."
- Prompt includes: faction preferences, unit usage patterns, win/loss streaks, map size preferences — all from SQLite aggregates.

**Adaptive briefings:**
- Campaign briefings reference your actual roster: "Commander, your veteran Tesla Tank squad from Vladivostok is available for this operation."
- Difficulty framing adapts to performance: struggling player gets "intel reports suggest light resistance"; dominant player gets "expect fierce opposition."
- Queries `roster_snapshots` and `campaign_missions` tables.

**Post-match commentary:**
- LLM generates a narrative summary of the match from `gameplay_events`: "The turning point was at 8:42 when your MiG strike destroyed the Allied War Factory, halting tank production for 3 minutes."
- Highlights unusual events: first-ever use of a unit type, personal records, close calls.
- Optional — disabled by default, requires LLM provider configured.

**Coaching suggestions:**
- "You built 40 Rifle Infantry across 5 games but they had a 12% survival rate. Consider mixing in APCs for transport."
- "Your average expansion timing is 6:30. Top players expand at 4:00-5:00."
- Queries aggregate statistics from `gameplay_events` across multiple sessions.

**Rivalry narratives:**
- Track frequent opponents from `matches` table: "You're 3-7 against PlayerX. They favor Allied air rushes — here's a counter-strategy mission."
- Generate rivalry-themed campaign missions featuring opponent tendencies.

### Adaptive AI (`ic-ai`)

`ic-ai` reads the player's match history to calibrate skirmish and campaign AI behavior. No learning during the match — all adaptation happens between games by querying SQLite.

- **Difficulty scaling:** AI selects from difficulty presets based on player win rate over recent N games. Avoids both stomps and frustration.
- **Build order variety:** AI avoids repeating the same strategy the player has already beaten. Queries `gameplay_events` for AI build patterns the player countered successfully.
- **Counter-strategy selection:** If the player's last 5 games show heavy tank play, AI is more likely to choose anti-armor compositions.
- **Campaign-specific:** In branching campaigns (D021), AI reads the player's roster strength from `roster_snapshots` and adjusts reinforcement timing accordingly.

This is designer-authored adaptation (the AI author sets the rules for how history influences behavior), not machine learning. The SQLite queries are simple aggregates run at mission load time.

**Fallback:** When no match history is available (first launch, empty database, WASM/headless builds without SQLite), `ic-ai` falls back to default difficulty presets and random strategy selection. All SQLite reads are behind an `Option<impl AiHistorySource>` — the AI is fully functional without it, just not personalized.

```

### Schema Migration

Each service manages its own schema using embedded SQL migrations (numbered, applied on startup). The `rusqlite` `user_version` pragma tracks the current schema version. Forward-only migrations — the binary upgrades the database file automatically on first launch after an update.

### Per-Database PRAGMA Configuration

Every SQLite database in IC gets a purpose-tuned PRAGMA configuration applied at connection open time. The correct settings depend on the database's access pattern (write-heavy vs. read-heavy), data criticality (irreplaceable credentials vs. recreatable cache), expected size, and concurrency requirements. A single "one size fits all" configuration would either sacrifice durability for databases that need it (credentials, achievements) or sacrifice throughput for databases that need speed (telemetry, gameplay events).

**All databases share these baseline PRAGMAs:**

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;          -- all databases use WAL (concurrent readers, non-blocking writes)
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;           -- enforced everywhere (except single-table telemetry)
PRAGMA encoding = 'UTF-8';         -- consistent text encoding
PRAGMA trusted_schema = OFF;        -- defense-in-depth: disable untrusted SQL functions in schema
```

`page_size` must be set **before** the first write to a new database (it cannot be changed after creation without `VACUUM`). All other PRAGMAs are applied on every connection open.

**Connection initialization pattern (Rust):**

```rust
/// Apply purpose-specific PRAGMAs to a freshly opened rusqlite::Connection.
/// Called immediately after Connection::open(), before any application queries.
fn configure_connection(conn: &Connection, config: &DbConfig) -> rusqlite::Result<()> {
    // page_size only effective on new databases (before first table creation)
    conn.pragma_update(None, "page_size", config.page_size)?;
    conn.pragma_update(None, "journal_mode", "wal")?;
    conn.pragma_update(None, "synchronous", config.synchronous)?;
    conn.pragma_update(None, "cache_size", config.cache_size)?;
    conn.pragma_update(None, "foreign_keys", config.foreign_keys)?;
    conn.pragma_update(None, "busy_timeout", config.busy_timeout_ms)?;
    conn.pragma_update(None, "temp_store", config.temp_store)?;
    conn.pragma_update(None, "wal_autocheckpoint", config.wal_autocheckpoint)?;
    conn.pragma_update(None, "trusted_schema", "off")?;
    if config.mmap_size > 0 {
        conn.pragma_update(None, "mmap_size", config.mmap_size)?;
    }
    if config.auto_vacuum != AutoVacuum::None {
        conn.pragma_update(None, "auto_vacuum", config.auto_vacuum.as_str())?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**Tournament server** uses the same configuration as relay data — brackets, match results, and map pool votes are signed records with identical durability requirements (`synchronous=FULL`, 8 MB cache, append-only growth).

#### Table-to-File Assignments for D047 and D057

Not every table set warrants its own `.db` file. Two decision areas have SQLite tables that live inside existing databases:

- **D047 LLM provider config** (`llm_providers`, `llm_task_routing`) → stored in **`profile.db`**. These are small config tables (~dozen rows) containing encrypted API keys — they inherit `profile.db`'s `synchronous=FULL` durability, which is appropriate for data that includes secrets. Co-locating with identity data keeps all "who am I and what are my settings" data in one backup-critical file.
- **D057 Skill Library** (`skills`, `skills_fts`, `skill_embeddings`, `skill_compositions`) → stored in **`gameplay.db`**. Skills are analytical data produced from gameplay — they benefit from `gameplay.db`'s 16 MB cache and 64 MB mmap (FTS5 keyword search and embedding similarity scans over potentially thousands of skills). A mature skill library with embeddings may reach 10–50 MB, well within `gameplay.db`'s 10–500 MB expected range. Co-locating with `gameplay_events` and `player_profiles` keeps all AI/LLM-consumed data queryable in one file.

#### Configuration Rationale

**`synchronous` — the most impactful setting:**

- **`FULL`** for databases storing irreplaceable data: `profile.db` (player identity), `achievements.db` (player investment), `communities/*.db` (signed credentials that require server contact to re-obtain), relay match data (signed `CertifiedMatchResult` records), and matchmaking ratings (player ELO/Glicko-2 history). `FULL` guarantees that a committed transaction survives even an OS crash or power failure — the fsync penalty is acceptable because these databases have low write frequency.
- **`NORMAL`** for everything else. In WAL mode, `NORMAL` still guarantees durability against application crashes (the WAL is synced before committing). Only an OS-level crash during a checkpoint could theoretically lose a transaction — an acceptable risk for telemetry events, gameplay analytics, and recreatable caches.

**`cache_size` — scaled to query complexity:**

- `gameplay.db` gets 16 MB because it runs the most complex queries: multi-table JOINs for career stats, aggregate functions over thousands of gameplay_events, FTS5 replay search. The large cache keeps hot index pages in memory across analytical queries.
- Server Workshop gets 16 MB for the same reason — FTS5 search over the entire resource registry benefits from a large page cache.
- `telemetry.db` (client and server) gets a moderate cache because writes dominate reads. The write path doesn't benefit from large caches — it's all sequential inserts.
- Small databases (`achievements.db`, `communities/*.db`) need minimal cache because their entire content fits in a few hundred pages.

**`mmap_size` — for read-heavy databases that grow large:**

- `gameplay.db` at 64 MB: after months of play, this database may contain hundreds of thousands of gameplay_events rows. Memory-mapping avoids repeated read syscalls during analytical queries like `PlayerStyleProfile` aggregation (D042). The 64 MB limit keeps memory pressure manageable on the minimum-spec 4 GB machine — just 1.6% of total RAM. If the database exceeds 64 MB, the remainder uses standard reads. On systems with ≥8 GB RAM, this could be scaled up at runtime.
- Server Workshop and Matchmaking at 128–256 MB: large registries and leaderboard scans benefit from mmap. Workshop search scans FTS5 index pages; matchmaking scans rating tables for top-N queries. Server hardware typically has ≥16 GB RAM.
- Write-dominated databases (`telemetry.db`) skip mmap entirely — the write path doesn't benefit, and mmap can actually hinder WAL performance by creating contention between mapped reads and WAL writes.

**`wal_autocheckpoint` — tuned to write cadence, with gameplay override:**

- Client `telemetry.db` at 4000 pages (≈16 MB WAL): telemetry writes are bursty during gameplay (potentially hundreds of events per second during intense combat). A large autocheckpoint threshold batches writes and defers the expensive checkpoint operation, preventing frame drops. The WAL file may grow to 16 MB during a match and get checkpointed during the post-game transition.
- Server `telemetry.db` at 8000 pages (≈32 MB WAL): relay servers handling multiple concurrent games need even larger write batches. The 32 MB WAL absorbs write bursts without checkpoint contention blocking game event recording.
- `gameplay.db` at 2000 pages (≈8 MB WAL): moderate — gameplay_events arrive faster than profile updates but slower than telemetry. The 8 MB buffer handles end-of-match write bursts.
- Small databases at 100–500 pages: writes are rare; keep the WAL file small and tidy.

**HDD-safe WAL checkpoint strategy:** The `wal_autocheckpoint` thresholds above are tuned for SSDs. On a 5400 RPM HDD (common on the 2012 min-spec laptop), a WAL checkpoint transfers dirty pages back to the main database file at scattered offsets — **random I/O**. A 16 MB checkpoint can produce 4000 random 4 KB writes, taking 200–500+ ms on a spinning disk. If this triggers during gameplay, the I/O thread stalls, the ring buffer fills, and events are silently lost.

**Mitigation: disable autocheckpoint during active gameplay, checkpoint at safe points.**

```rust
/// During match load, disable automatic checkpointing on gameplay-active databases.
/// The I/O thread calls this after opening connections.
fn enter_gameplay_mode(conn: &Connection) -> rusqlite::Result<()> {
    conn.pragma_update(None, "wal_autocheckpoint", 0)?; // 0 = disable auto
    Ok(())
}

/// At safe points (loading screen, post-game stats, main menu, single-player pause),
/// trigger a passive checkpoint that yields if it encounters contention.
fn checkpoint_at_safe_point(conn: &Connection) -> rusqlite::Result<()> {
    // PASSIVE: checkpoint pages that don't require blocking readers.
    // Does not block, does not stall. May leave some pages un-checkpointed.
    conn.pragma_update(None, "wal_checkpoint", "PASSIVE")?;
    Ok(())
}

/// On match end or app exit, restore normal autocheckpoint thresholds.
fn leave_gameplay_mode(conn: &Connection, normal_threshold: u32) -> rusqlite::Result<()> {
    conn.pragma_update(None, "wal_autocheckpoint", normal_threshold)?;
    // Full checkpoint now — we're in a loading/menu screen, stall is acceptable.
    conn.pragma_update(None, "wal_checkpoint", "TRUNCATE")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

**Safe checkpoint points** (I/O thread triggers these, never the game thread):
- Match loading screen (before gameplay starts)
- Post-game stats screen (results displayed, no sim running)
- Main menu / lobby (no active sim)
- Single-player pause menu (sim is frozen — user is already waiting)
- App exit / minimize / suspend

**WAL file growth during gameplay:** With autocheckpoint disabled, the WAL grows unbounded during a match. Worst case for a 60-minute match at peak event rates: telemetry.db WAL may reach ~50–100 MB, gameplay.db WAL ~20–40 MB. On a 4 GB min-spec machine, this is ~2–3% of RAM — acceptable. The WAL is truncated on the post-game `TRUNCATE` checkpoint. Players on SSDs experience no difference — checkpoint takes <50 ms regardless of timing.

**Detection:** The I/O thread queries storage type at startup via Bevy's platform detection (or heuristic: sequential read bandwidth vs. random IOPS ratio). If HDD is detected (or cannot be determined — conservative default), gameplay WAL checkpoint suppression activates automatically. SSD users keep the normal `wal_autocheckpoint` thresholds. The `storage.assume_ssd` cvar overrides detection.

**`auto_vacuum` — only where deletions create waste:**

- `INCREMENTAL` for `profile.db` (avatar/banner image replacements leave pages of dead BLOB data), `workshop/cache.db` (mod uninstalls remove metadata rows), and server Workshop (resource unpublish). Incremental mode marks freed pages for reuse without the full-table rewrite cost of `FULL` auto_vacuum. Reclamation happens via periodic `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum(N)` calls on background threads.
- `NONE` everywhere else. Telemetry uses DELETE-based pruning but full VACUUM is only warranted on export (compaction). Achievements, community credentials, and match history grow monotonically — no deletions means no wasted space. Relay match data is append-only.

**`busy_timeout` — preventing SQLITE_BUSY errors:**

- 1 second for client `telemetry.db`: telemetry writes must never cause visible gameplay lag. If the database is locked for over 1 second, something is seriously wrong — better to drop the event than stall the game loop.
- 2 seconds for `gameplay.db`: UI queries (career stats page) occasionally overlap with background event writes. All `gameplay.db` writes happen on a dedicated I/O thread (see "Transaction batching" above), so `busy_timeout` waits occur on the I/O thread — never on the game loop thread. 2 seconds is sufficient for typical contention.
- 5 seconds for server telemetry: high-throughput event recording on servers can create brief WAL contention during checkpoints. Server hardware and dedicated I/O threads make a 5-second timeout acceptable.
- 10 seconds for server Workshop and Matchmaking: web API requests may queue behind write transactions during peak load. A generous timeout prevents spurious failures.

**`temp_store = MEMORY` — for databases that run complex queries:**

- `gameplay.db`, `telemetry.db`, Workshop, Matchmaking: complex analytical queries (GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN) may create temporary tables or sort buffers. Storing these in RAM avoids disk I/O overhead for intermediate results.
- Profile, achievements, community databases: queries are simple key lookups and small result sets — `DEFAULT` (disk-backed temp) is fine and avoids unnecessary memory pressure.

**`foreign_keys = OFF` for `telemetry.db` only:**

- The unified telemetry schema is a single table with no foreign keys. Disabling the pragma avoids the per-statement FK check overhead on every INSERT — measurable savings at high event rates.
- All other databases have proper FK relationships and enforce them.

#### WASM Platform Adjustments

Browser builds (via `sql.js` or `sqlite-wasm` on OPFS) operate under different constraints:

- **`mmap_size = 0`** always — mmap is not available in WASM environments
- **`cache_size`** reduced by 50% — browser memory budgets are tighter
- **`synchronous = NORMAL`** for all databases — OPFS provides its own durability guarantees and the browser may not honor fsync semantics
- **`wal_autocheckpoint`** kept at default (1000) — OPFS handles sequential I/O differently than native filesystems; large WAL files offer less benefit

These adjustments are applied automatically by the `DbConfig` builder when it detects the WASM target at compile time (`#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`).

### Scaling Path

SQLite is the default and the right choice for 95% of deployments. For the official infrastructure at high scale, individual services can optionally be configured to use PostgreSQL by swapping the storage backend trait implementation. The schema is designed to be portable (standard SQL, no SQLite-specific syntax). FTS5 is used for full-text search on Workshop and replay catalogs — a PostgreSQL backend would substitute `tsvector`/`tsquery` for the same queries. This is a future optimization, not a launch requirement.

Each service defines its own storage trait — no god-trait mixing unrelated concerns:

```rust
/// Relay server storage — match results, desync reports, behavioral profiles.
pub trait RelayStorage: Send + Sync {
    fn store_match_result(&self, result: &CertifiedMatchResult) -> Result<()>;
    fn query_matches(&self, filter: &MatchFilter) -> Result<Vec<MatchRecord>>;
    fn store_desync_report(&self, report: &DesyncReport) -> Result<()>;
    fn update_behavior_profile(&self, player: PlayerId, profile: &BehaviorProfile) -> Result<()>;
}

/// Matchmaking server storage — ratings, match history, leaderboards.
pub trait MatchmakingStorage: Send + Sync {
    fn update_rating(&self, player: PlayerId, rating: &Glicko2Rating) -> Result<()>;
    fn leaderboard(&self, scope: &LeaderboardScope, limit: u32) -> Result<Vec<LeaderboardEntry>>;
    fn match_history(&self, player: PlayerId, limit: u32) -> Result<Vec<MatchRecord>>;
}

/// Workshop server storage — resource metadata, versions, dependencies, search.
pub trait WorkshopStorage: Send + Sync {
    fn publish_resource(&self, meta: &ResourceMetadata) -> Result<()>;
    fn search(&self, query: &str, filter: &ResourceFilter) -> Result<Vec<ResourceListing>>;
    fn resolve_deps(&self, root: &ResourceId, range: &VersionRange) -> Result<DependencyGraph>;
}

/// SQLite implementation — each service gets its own SqliteXxxStorage struct
/// wrapping a rusqlite::Connection (WAL mode, foreign keys on, journal_size_limit set).
/// PostgreSQL implementations are optional, behind `#[cfg(feature = "postgres")]`.
```

### Alternatives Considered

- **JSON / TOML flat files** (rejected — no query capability; "what's my win rate on this map?" requires loading every match file and filtering in code; no indexing, no FTS, no joins; scales poorly past hundreds of records; the user's data is opaque to external tools unless we also build export scripts)
- **RocksDB / sled / redb** (rejected — key-value stores require application-level query logic for everything; no SQL means no ad-hoc investigation, no external tool compatibility, no community reuse; the data is locked behind IC-specific access patterns)
- **PostgreSQL as default** (rejected — destroys the "just a binary" deployment model; community relay operators shouldn't need to install and maintain a database server; adds operational complexity for zero benefit at community scale)
- **Redis** (rejected — in-memory only by default; no persistence guarantees without configuration; no SQL; wrong tool for durable structured records)
- **Custom binary format** (rejected — maximum vendor lock-in; the community can't build anything on top of it without reverse engineering; contradicts the open-standard philosophy)
- **No persistent storage; compute everything from replay files** (rejected — replays are large, parsing is expensive, and many queries span multiple sessions; pre-computed aggregates in SQLite make career stats and AI adaptation instant)

**Phase:** SQLite storage for relay and client lands in Phase 2 (replay catalog, save game index, gameplay event log). Workshop server storage lands in Phase 6a (D030). Matchmaking and tournament storage land in Phase 5 (competitive infrastructure). The `StorageBackend` trait is defined early but PostgreSQL implementation is deferred until scale requires it.

## D038 — Scenario Editor (OFP/Eden-Inspired, SDK)

**Resolves:** P005 (Map editor architecture)

**Decision:** Visual scenario editor — not just a map/terrain painter, but a full mission authoring tool inspired by Operation Flashpoint's mission editor (2001) and Arma 3's Eden Editor (2016). Ships as part of the **IC SDK** (separate application from the game — see D040 § SDK Architecture). Live isometric preview via shared Bevy crates. Combines terrain editing (tiles, resources, cliffs) with scenario logic editing (unit placement, triggers, waypoints, modules). Two complexity tiers: Simple mode (accessible) and Advanced mode (full power).

**Rationale:**

The OFP mission editor is one of the most successful content creation tools in gaming history. It shipped with a $40 game in 2001 and generated thousands of community missions across 15 years — despite having no undo button. Its success came from three principles:

1. **Accessibility through layered complexity.** Easy mode hides advanced fields. A beginner places units and waypoints in minutes. An advanced user adds triggers, conditions, probability of presence, and scripting. Same data, different UI.
2. **Emergent behavior from simple building blocks.** Guard + Guarded By creates dynamic multi-group defense behavior from pure placement — zero scripting. Synchronization lines coordinate multi-group operations. Triggers with countdown/timeout timers and min/mid/max randomization create unpredictable encounters.
3. **Instant preview collapses the edit→test loop.** Place things on the actual map, hit "Test" to launch the game with your scenario loaded. Hot-reload keeps the loop tight — edit in the SDK, changes appear in the running game within seconds.

Eden Editor (2016) evolved these principles: 3D placement, undo/redo, 154 pre-built modules (complex logic as drag-and-drop nodes), compositions (reusable prefabs), layers (organizational folders), and Steam Workshop publishing directly from the editor. Arma Reforger (2022) added budget systems, behavior trees for waypoints, controller support, and a real-time Game Master mode.

**Iron Curtain applies these lessons to the RTS genre.** An RTS scenario editor has different needs than a military sim — isometric view instead of first-person, base-building and resource placement instead of terrain sculpting, wave-based encounters instead of patrol routes. But the underlying principles are identical: layered complexity, emergent behavior from simple rules, and zero barrier between editing and playing.

### Architecture

The scenario editor lives in the `ic-editor` crate and ships as part of the **IC SDK** — a separate Bevy application from the game (see D040 § SDK Architecture for the full separation rationale). It reuses the game's rendering and simulation crates: `ic-render` (isometric viewport), `ic-sim` (preview playback), `ic-ui` (shared UI components like panels and attribute editors), and `ic-protocol` (order types for preview). `ic-game` does NOT depend on `ic-editor` — the game binary has zero editor code. The SDK binary (`ic-sdk`) bundles the scenario editor, asset studio (D040), campaign editor, and Game Master mode in a single application with a tab-based workspace.

**Test/preview communication:** When the user hits "Test," the SDK serializes the current scenario and launches `ic-game` with it loaded, using a `LocalNetwork` (from `ic-net`). The game runs the scenario identically to normal gameplay — the sim never knows it was launched from the SDK. For quick in-SDK preview (without launching the full game), the SDK can also run `ic-sim` internally with a lightweight preview viewport. Editor-generated inputs (e.g., placing a debug unit mid-preview) are submitted as `PlayerOrder`s through `ic-protocol`. The hot-reload bridge watches for file changes and pushes updates to the running game test session.

### Entity Palette UX

The Entities mode panel provides the primary browse/select interface for all placeable objects. Inspired by Garry's Mod's spawn menu (`Q` menu) — the gold standard for navigating massive asset libraries — the palette includes:

- **Search-as-you-type** across all entities (units, structures, props, modules, compositions) — filters the tree in real time
- **Favorites list** — star frequently-used items; persisted per-user in SQLite (D034). A dedicated Favorites tab at the top of the palette
- **Recently placed** — shows the last 20 entities placed this session, most recent first. One click to re-select
- **Per-category browsing** with collapsible subcategories (faction → unit type → specific unit). Categories are game-module-defined via YAML
- **Thumbnail previews** — small sprite/icon preview next to each entry. Hovering shows a larger preview with stats summary

The same palette UX applies to the Compositions Library panel, the Module selector, and the Trigger type picker — search/favorites/recents are universal navigation patterns across all editor panels.

### Entity Attributes Panel

Every placed entity has a GUI properties panel (no code required). This replaces OFP's "Init" field for most use cases while keeping advanced scripting available.

**Unit attributes (example):**

| Attribute                   | Type              | Description                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Type**                    | dropdown          | Unit class (filtered by faction)           |
| **Name**                    | text              | Variable name for Lua scripting            |
| **Faction**                 | dropdown          | Owner: Player 1–8, Neutral, Creeps         |
| **Facing**                  | slider 0–360      | Starting direction                         |
| **Stance**                  | enum              | Guard / Patrol / Hold / Aggressive         |
| **Health**                  | slider 0–100%     | Starting hit points                        |
| **Veterancy**               | enum              | None / Rookie / Veteran / Elite            |
| **Probability of Presence** | slider 0–100%     | Random chance to exist at mission start    |
| **Condition of Presence**   | expression        | Lua boolean (e.g., `difficulty >= "hard"`) |
| **Placement Radius**        | slider 0–10 cells | Random starting position within radius     |
| **Init Script**             | text (multi-line) | Inline Lua — the primary scripting surface |

**Probability of Presence** is the single most important replayability feature from OFP. Every entity — units, buildings, resource patches, props — can have a percentage chance of existing when the mission loads. Combined with Condition of Presence, this creates two-factor randomization: "50% chance this tank platoon spawns, but only on Hard difficulty." A player replaying the same mission encounters different enemy compositions each time. This is trivially deterministic — the mission seed determines all rolls.

### Named Regions

Inspired by Age of Empires II's trigger areas and StarCraft's "locations" — both independently proved that named spatial zones are how non-programmers think about RTS mission logic. A **region** is a named area on the map (rectangle or ellipse) that can be referenced by name across multiple triggers, modules, and scripts.

Regions are NOT triggers — they have no logic of their own. They are spatial labels. A region named `bridge_crossing` can be referenced by:
- Trigger 1: "IF Player 1 faction present in `bridge_crossing` → activate reinforcements"
- Trigger 2: "IF `bridge_crossing` has no enemies → play victory audio"
- Lua script: `Region.unit_count("bridge_crossing", faction.allied) >= 5`
- Module: Wave Spawner configured to spawn at `bridge_crossing`

This separation prevents the common RTS editor mistake of coupling spatial areas to individual triggers. In AoE2, if three triggers need to reference the same map area, you create three identical areas. In IC, you create one region and reference it three times.

**Region attributes:**

| Attribute   | Type               | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**    | text               | Unique identifier (e.g., `enemy_base`, `ambush_zone`) |
| **Shape**   | rect / ellipse     | Cell-aligned or free-form                             |
| **Color**   | color picker       | Editor visualization color (not visible in-game)      |
| **Tags**    | text[]             | Optional categorization for search/filter             |
| **Z-layer** | ground / air / any | Which unit layers the region applies to               |

### Inline Scripting (OFP-Style)

OFP's most powerful feature was also its simplest: double-click a unit, type a line of SQF in the Init field, done. No separate IDE, no file management, no project setup. The scripting lived *on the entity*. For anything complex, the Init field called an external script file — one line bridges the gap between visual editing and full programming.

IC follows the same model with Lua. The **Init Script** field on every entity is the primary scripting surface — not a secondary afterthought.

**Inline scripting examples:**

```lua
-- Simple: one-liner directly on the entity
this:set_stance("hold")

-- Medium: a few lines of inline behavior
this:set_patrol_route("north_road")
this:on_damaged(function() Var.set("alarm_triggered", true) end)

-- Complex: inline calls an external script file
dofile("scripts/elite_guard.lua")(this)

-- OFP equivalent of `nul = [this] execVM "patrol.sqf"`
run_script("scripts/convoy_escort.lua", { unit = this, route = "highway" })
```

This is exactly how OFP worked: most units have no Init script at all (pure visual placement). Some have one-liners. A few call external files for complex behavior. The progression is organic — a designer starts with visual placement, realizes they need a small tweak, types a line, and naturally graduates to scripting when they're ready. No mode switch, no separate tool.

**Inline scripts run at entity spawn time** — when the mission loads (or when the entity is dynamically spawned by a trigger/module). The `this` variable refers to the entity the script is attached to.

**Triggers and modules also have inline script fields:**
- Trigger **On Activation**: inline Lua that runs when the trigger fires
- Trigger **On Deactivation**: inline Lua for repeatable triggers
- Module **Custom Logic**: override or extend a module's default behavior

Every inline script field has:
- **Syntax highlighting** for Lua with IC API keywords
- **Autocompletion** for entity names, region names, variables, and the IC Lua API (D024)
- **Error markers** shown inline before preview (not in a crash log)
- **Expand button** — opens the field in a larger editing pane for multi-line scripts without leaving the entity's properties panel

### Script Files Panel

When inline scripts call external files (`dofile("scripts/ambush.lua")`), those files need to live somewhere. The **Script Files Panel** manages them — it's the editor for the external script files that inline scripts reference.

This is the same progression OFP used: Init field → `execVM "script.sqf"` → the .sqf file lives in the mission folder. IC keeps the external files *inside the editor* rather than requiring alt-tab to a text editor.

**Script Files Panel features:**
- **File browser** — lists all `.lua` files in the mission
- **New file** — create a script file, it's immediately available to inline `dofile()` calls
- **Syntax highlighting** and **autocompletion** (same as inline fields)
- **Live reload** — edit a script file during preview, save, changes take effect next tick
- **API reference sidebar** — searchable IC Lua API docs without leaving the editor
- **Breakpoints and watch** (Advanced mode) — pause the sim on a breakpoint, inspect variables

**Script scope hierarchy (mirrors the natural progression):**
```
Inline init scripts  — on entities, run at spawn (the starting point)
Inline trigger scripts — on triggers, run on activation/deactivation
External script files  — called by inline scripts for complex logic
Mission init script    — special file that runs once at mission start
```

The tiered model: most users never write a script. Some write one-liners on entities. A few create external files. The progression is seamless — there's no cliff between "visual editing" and "programming," just a gentle slope that starts with `this:set_stance("hold")`.

### Variables Panel

AoE2 scenario designers used invisible units placed off-screen as makeshift variables. StarCraft modders abused the "deaths" counter as integer storage. Both are hacks because the editors lacked native state management.

IC provides a **Variables Panel** — mission-wide state visible and editable in the GUI. Triggers and modules can read/write variables without Lua.

| Variable Type | Example                     | Use Case                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Switch**    | `bridge_destroyed` (on/off) | Boolean flags for trigger conditions |
| **Counter**   | `waves_survived` (integer)  | Counting events, tracking progress   |
| **Timer**     | `mission_clock` (ticks)     | Elapsed time tracking                |
| **Text**      | `player_callsign` (string)  | Dynamic text for briefings/dialogue  |

**Variable operations in triggers (no Lua required):**
- Set variable, increment/decrement counter, toggle switch
- Condition: "IF `waves_survived` >= 5 → trigger victory"
- Module connection: Wave Spawner increments `waves_survived` after each wave

Variables are visible in the Variables Panel, named by the designer, and referenced by name everywhere. Lua scripts access them via `Var.get("waves_survived")` / `Var.set("waves_survived", 5)`. All variables are deterministic sim state (included in snapshots and replays).

### Scenario Complexity Meter

Inspired by TimeSplitters' memory bar — a persistent, always-visible indicator of scenario complexity and estimated performance impact.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Complexity: ████████████░░░░░░░░  58%       │
│  Entities: 247/500  Triggers: 34/200         │
│  Scripts: 3 files   Regions: 12              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The meter reflects:
- **Entity count** vs recommended maximum (per target platform)
- **Trigger count** and nesting depth
- **Script complexity** (line count, hook count)
- **Estimated tick cost** — based on entity types and AI behaviors

The meter is a **guideline, not a hard limit**. Exceeding 100% shows a warning ("This scenario may perform poorly on lower-end hardware") but doesn't prevent saving or publishing. Power users can push past it; casual creators stay within safe bounds without thinking about performance.

### Trigger Organization

The AoE2 Scenario Editor's trigger list collapses into an unmanageable wall at 200+ triggers — no folders, no search, no visual overview. IC prevents this from day one:

- **Folders** — group triggers by purpose ("Phase 1", "Enemy AI", "Cinematics", "Victory Conditions")
- **Search / Filter** — find triggers by name, condition type, connected entity, or variable reference
- **Color coding** — triggers inherit their folder's color for visual scanning
- **Flow graph view** — toggle between list view and a visual node graph showing trigger chains, connections to modules, and variable flow. Read-only visualization, not a node-based editor (that's the "Alternatives Considered" item). Lets designers see the big picture of complex mission logic without reading every trigger.
- **Collapse / expand** — folders collapse to single lines; individual triggers collapse to show only name + condition summary

### Undo / Redo

OFP's editor shipped without undo. Eden added it 15 years later. IC ships with full undo/redo from day one.

- **Unlimited undo stack** (bounded by memory, not count)
- Covers all operations: entity placement/deletion/move, trigger edits, terrain painting, variable changes, layer operations
- **Redo** restores undone actions until a new action branches the history
- Undo history survives save/load within a session
- **Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y** (desktop), equivalent bindings on controller

### Autosave & Crash Recovery

OFP's editor had no undo and no autosave — one misclick or crash could destroy hours of work. IC ships with both from day one.

- **Autosave** — configurable interval (default: every 5 minutes). Writes to a rotating set of 3 autosave slots so a corrupted save doesn't overwrite the only backup
- **Pre-preview save** — the editor automatically saves a snapshot before entering preview mode. If the game crashes during preview, the editor state is preserved
- **Recovery on launch** — if the editor detects an unclean shutdown (crash), it offers to restore from the most recent autosave: "The editor was not closed properly. Restore from autosave (2 minutes ago)? [Restore] [Discard]"
- **Undo history persistence** — the undo stack is included in autosaves. Restoring from autosave also restores the ability to undo recent changes
- **Manual save is always available** — Ctrl+S saves to the scenario file. Autosave supplements manual save, never replaces it

### Trigger System (RTS-Adapted)

OFP's trigger system adapted for RTS gameplay:

| Attribute            | Description                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Area**             | Rectangle or ellipse on the isometric map (cell-aligned or free-form)                                                |
| **Activation**       | Who triggers it: Any Player / Specific Player / Any Unit / Faction Units / No Unit (condition-only)                  |
| **Condition Type**   | Present / Not Present / Destroyed / Built / Captured / Harvested                                                     |
| **Custom Condition** | Lua expression (e.g., `Player.cash(1) >= 5000`)                                                                      |
| **Repeatable**       | Once or Repeatedly (with re-arm)                                                                                     |
| **Timer**            | Countdown (fires after delay, condition can lapse) or Timeout (condition must persist for full duration)             |
| **Timer Values**     | Min / Mid / Max — randomized, gravitating toward Mid. Prevents predictable timing.                                   |
| **Trigger Type**     | None / Victory / Defeat / Reveal Area / Spawn Wave / Play Audio / Weather Change / Reinforcements / Objective Update |
| **On Activation**    | Advanced: Lua script                                                                                                 |
| **On Deactivation**  | Advanced: Lua script (repeatable triggers only)                                                                      |
| **Effects**          | Play music / Play sound / Play video / Show message / Camera flash / Screen shake / Enter cinematic mode             |

**RTS-specific trigger conditions:**

| Condition               | Description                                                         | OFP Equivalent   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `faction_present`       | Any unit of faction X is alive inside the trigger area              | Side Present     |
| `faction_not_present`   | No units of faction X inside trigger area                           | Side Not Present |
| `building_destroyed`    | Specific building is destroyed                                      | N/A              |
| `building_captured`     | Specific building changed ownership                                 | N/A              |
| `building_built`        | Player has constructed building type X                              | N/A              |
| `unit_count`            | Faction has ≥ N units of type X alive                               | N/A              |
| `resources_collected`   | Player has harvested ≥ N resources                                  | N/A              |
| `timer_elapsed`         | N ticks since mission start (or since trigger activation)           | N/A              |
| `area_seized`           | Faction dominates the trigger area (adapted from OFP's "Seized by") | Seized by Side   |
| `all_destroyed_in_area` | Every enemy unit/building inside the area is destroyed              | N/A              |
| `custom_lua`            | Arbitrary Lua expression                                            | Custom Condition |

**Countdown vs Timeout with Min/Mid/Max** is crucial for RTS missions. Example: "Reinforcements arrive 3–7 minutes after the player captures the bridge" (Countdown, Min=3m, Mid=5m, Max=7m). The player can't memorize the exact timing. In OFP, this was the key to making missions feel alive rather than scripted.

### Module System (Pre-Packaged Logic Nodes)

Modules are IC's equivalent of Eden Editor's 154 built-in modules — complex game logic packaged as drag-and-drop nodes with a properties panel. Non-programmers get 80% of the power without writing Lua.

**Built-in module library (initial set):**

| Category        | Module             | Parameters                                    | Logic                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **AI Behavior** | Patrol Route       | waypoints[], alert_radius, response           | Units cycle waypoints, engage if threat detected                                                                                                                                                |

| **Multiplayer** | Spectator Bookmark | position, label, trigger, camera_angle        | Author-defined camera bookmark for spectator/replay mode — marks key locations and dramatic moments. Spectators can cycle bookmarks with hotkeys. Replays auto-cut to bookmarks when triggered. |

Modules connect to triggers and other entities via **visual connection lines** — same as OFP's synchronization system. A "Reinforcements" module connected to a trigger means the reinforcements arrive when the trigger fires. No scripting required.

**Custom modules** can be created by modders — a YAML definition + Lua implementation, publishable via Workshop (D030). The community can extend the module library indefinitely.

### Compositions (Reusable Building Blocks)

Compositions are saved groups of entities, triggers, modules, and connections — like Eden Editor's custom compositions. They bridge the gap between individual entity placement and full scene templates (04-MODDING.md).

**Hierarchy:**

```
Entity           — single unit, building, trigger, or module
  ↓ grouped into
Composition      — reusable cluster (base layout, defensive formation, scripted encounter)
  ↓ assembled into
Scenario         — complete mission with objectives, terrain, all compositions placed
  ↓ sequenced into (via Campaign Editor)
Campaign         — branching multi-mission graph with persistent state, intermissions, and dialogue (D021)
```

**Built-in compositions:**

| Composition         | Contents                                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Soviet Base (Small) | Construction Yard, Power Plant, Barracks, Ore Refinery, 3 harvesters, guard units |
| Allied Outpost      | Pillbox ×2, AA Gun, Power Plant, guard units with patrol waypoints                |
| Ore Field (Rich)    | Ore cells + ore truck spawn trigger                                               |
| Ambush Point        | Hidden units + area trigger + attack waypoints (Probability of Presence per unit) |
| Bridge Checkpoint   | Bridge + guarding units + trigger for crossing detection                          |
| Air Patrol          | Aircraft with looping patrol waypoints + scramble trigger                         |
| Coastal Defense     | Naval turrets + submarine patrol + radar                                          |

**Workflow:**
1. Place entities, arrange them, connect triggers/modules
2. Select all → "Save as Composition" → name, category, description, tags, thumbnail
3. Composition appears in the Compositions Library panel (searchable, with favorites — same palette UX as the entity panel)
4. Drag composition onto any map to place a pre-built cluster
5. Publish to Workshop (D030) — community compositions become shared building blocks

**Compositions are individually publishable.** Unlike scenarios (which are complete missions), a single composition can be published as a standalone Workshop resource — a "Soviet Base (Large)" layout, a "Scripted Ambush" encounter template, a "Tournament Start" formation. Other designers browse and install individual compositions, just as Garry's Mod's Advanced Duplicator lets players share and browse individual contraptions independently of full maps. Composition metadata (name, description, thumbnail, tags, author, dependencies) enables a browsable composition library within the Workshop, not just a flat file list.

This completes the content creation pipeline: compositions are the visual-editor equivalent of scene templates (04-MODDING.md). Scene templates are YAML/Lua for programmatic use and LLM generation. Compositions are the same concept for visual editing. They share the same underlying data format — a composition saved in the editor can be loaded as a scene template by Lua/LLM, and vice versa.

### Layers

Organizational folders for managing complex scenarios:

- Group entities by purpose: "Phase 1 — Base Defense", "Phase 2 — Counterattack", "Enemy Patrols", "Civilian Traffic"
- **Visibility toggle** — hide layers in the editor without affecting runtime (essential when a mission has 500+ entities)
- **Lock toggle** — prevent accidental edits to finalized layers
- **Runtime show/hide** — Lua can show/hide entire layers at runtime: `Layer.activate("Phase2_Reinforcements")` / `Layer.deactivate(...)`. Activating a layer spawns all entities in it as a batch; deactivating despawns them. These are **sim operations** (deterministic, included in snapshots and replays), not editor operations — the Lua API name uses `Layer`, not `Editor`, to make the boundary clear. Internally, each entity has a `layer: Option<String>` field; activation toggles a per-layer `active` flag that the spawn system reads. Entities in inactive layers do not exist in the sim — they are serialized in the scenario file but not instantiated until activation. **Deactivation is destructive:** calling `Layer.deactivate()` despawns all entities in the layer — any runtime state (damage taken, position changes, veterancy gained) is lost. Re-activating the layer spawns fresh copies from the scenario template. This is intentional: layers model "reinforcement waves" and "phase transitions," not pausable unit groups. For scenarios that need to preserve unit state across activation cycles, use Lua variables or campaign state (D021) to snapshot and restore specific values

### Media & Cinematics

Original Red Alert's campaign identity was defined as much by its media as its gameplay — FMV briefings before missions, the radar panel switching to a video feed during gameplay, Hell March driving the combat tempo, EVA voice lines as constant tactical feedback. A campaign editor that can't orchestrate media is a campaign editor that can't recreate what made C&C campaigns feel like C&C campaigns.

The modding layer (`04-MODDING.md`) defines the primitives: `video_playback` scene templates with display modes (`fullscreen`, `radar_comm`, `picture_in_picture`), `scripted_scene` templates, and the `Media` Lua global. The scenario editor surfaces all of these as **visual modules** — no Lua required for standard use, Lua available for advanced control.

#### Video Playback

The **Video Playback** module plays video files (`.vqa`, `.mp4`, `.webm`) at a designer-specified trigger point. Three display modes (from `04-MODDING.md`):

| Display Mode         | Behavior                                                                          | Inspiration                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `fullscreen`         | Pauses gameplay, fills screen, letterboxed. Classic FMV briefing.                 | RA1 mission briefings           |
| `radar_comm`         | Video replaces the radar/minimap panel. Game continues. Sidebar stays functional. | RA2 EVA / commander video calls |
| `picture_in_picture` | Small floating video overlay in a corner. Game continues. Dismissible.            | Modern RTS cinematics           |

**Module properties in the editor:**

| Property         | Type                  | Description                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Video**        | file picker           | Video file reference (from mission assets or Workshop dependency) |
| **Display mode** | dropdown              | `fullscreen` / `radar_comm` / `picture_in_picture`                |
| **Trigger**      | connection            | When to play — connected to a trigger, module, or "mission start" |
| **Skippable**    | checkbox              | Whether the player can press Escape to skip                       |
| **Subtitle**     | text (optional)       | Subtitle text shown during playback (accessibility)               |
| **On Complete**  | connection (optional) | Trigger or module to activate when the video finishes             |

**Radar Comm** deserves special emphasis — it's the feature that makes in-mission storytelling possible without interrupting gameplay. A commander calls in during a battle, their face appears in the radar panel, they deliver a line, and the radar returns. The designer connects a Video Playback (mode: `radar_comm`) to a trigger, and that's it. No scripting, no timeline editor, no separate cinematic tool.

For missions without custom video, the **Radar Comm** module (separate from Video Playback) provides the same radar-panel takeover using a static portrait + audio + subtitle text — the RA2 communication experience without requiring video production.

#### Cinematic Sequences

Individual modules (Camera Pan, Video Playback, Dialogue, Music Trigger) handle single media events. A **Cinematic Sequence** chains them into a scripted multi-step sequence — the editor equivalent of a cutscene director.

**Sequence step types:**

| Step Type      | Parameters                                   | What It Does                                             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `camera_pan`   | from, to, duration, easing                   | Smooth camera movement between positions                 |
| `camera_shake` | intensity, duration                          | Screen shake (explosion, impact)                         |
| `dialogue`     | speaker, portrait, text, audio_ref, duration | Character speech bubble / subtitle overlay               |
| `play_video`   | video_ref, display_mode                      | Video playback (any display mode)                        |
| `play_music`   | track, fade_in                               | Music change with crossfade                              |
| `play_sound`   | sound_ref, position (optional)               | Sound effect — positional or global                      |
| `wait`         | duration                                     | Pause between steps (in game ticks or seconds)           |
| `spawn_units`  | units[], position, faction                   | Dramatic unit reveal (reinforcements arriving on-camera) |
| `destroy`      | target                                       | Scripted destruction (building collapses, bridge blows)  |
| `weather`      | type, intensity, transition_time             | Weather change synchronized with the sequence            |
| `letterbox`    | enable/disable, transition_time              | Toggle cinematic letterbox bars                          |
| `set_variable` | name, value                                  | Set a mission or campaign variable during the sequence   |
| `lua`          | script                                       | Advanced: arbitrary Lua for anything not covered above   |

**Cinematic Sequence module properties:**

| Property        | Type                  | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Steps**       | ordered list          | Sequence of steps (drag-to-reorder in the editor)             |
| **Trigger**     | connection            | When to start the sequence                                    |
| **Skippable**   | checkbox              | Whether the player can skip the entire sequence               |
| **Pause sim**   | checkbox              | Whether gameplay pauses during the sequence (default: yes)    |
| **Letterbox**   | checkbox              | Auto-enter letterbox mode when sequence starts (default: yes) |
| **On Complete** | connection (optional) | What fires when the sequence finishes                         |

**Visual editing:** Steps are shown as a vertical timeline in the module's expanded properties panel. Each step has a colored icon by type. Drag steps to reorder. Click a camera_pan step to see from/to positions highlighted on the map. Click "Preview from step" to test a subsequence without playing the whole thing.

**Example — mission intro cinematic:**

```
Cinematic Sequence: "Mission 3 Intro"
  Trigger: mission_start
  Skippable: yes
  Pause sim: yes

  Steps:
  1. [letterbox]   enable, 0.5s transition
  2. [camera_pan]  from: player_base → to: enemy_fortress, 3s, ease_in_out
  3. [dialogue]    Stavros: "The enemy has fortified the river crossing."
  4. [play_sound]  artillery_distant.wav (global)
  5. [camera_shake] intensity: 0.3, duration: 0.5s
  6. [camera_pan]  to: bridge_crossing, 2s
  7. [dialogue]    Tanya: "I see a weak point in their eastern wall."
  8. [play_music]  "hell_march_v2", fade_in: 2s
  9. [letterbox]   disable, 0.5s transition
```

This replaces what would be 40+ lines of Lua with a visual drag-and-drop sequence. The designer sees the whole flow, reorders steps, previews specific moments, and never touches code.

#### Dynamic Music

`ic-audio` supports dynamic music states (combat/ambient/tension) that respond to game state (see `13-PHILOSOPHY.md` — Klepacki's game-tempo philosophy). The editor exposes this through two mechanisms:

**1. Music Trigger module** — simple track swap on trigger activation. Already in the module table. Good for scripted moments ("play Hell March when the tanks roll out").

**2. Music Playlist module** — manages an active playlist with playback modes:

| Mode         | Behavior                                                                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sequential` | Play tracks in order, loop                                                              |
| `shuffle`    | Random order, no immediate repeats                                                      |
| `dynamic`    | Engine selects track based on game state — `combat` / `ambient` / `tension` / `victory` |

**Dynamic mode** is the key feature. The designer tags tracks by mood:

```yaml
music_playlist:
  combat:
    - hell_march
    - grinder
    - drill
  ambient:
    - fogger
    - trenches
    - mud
  tension:
    - radio_2
    - face_the_enemy
  victory:
    - credits
```

The engine monitors game state (active combat, unit losses, base threat, objective progress) and crossfades between mood categories automatically. No triggers required — the music responds to what's happening. The designer curates the playlist; the engine handles transitions.

**Crossfade control:** Music Trigger and Music Playlist modules both support `fade_time` — the duration of the crossfade between the current track and the new one. Default: 2 seconds. Set to 0 for a hard cut (dramatic moments).

#### Ambient Sound Zones

**Ambient Sound Zone** modules tie looping environmental audio to named regions. Walk units near a river — hear water. Move through a forest — hear birds and wind. Approach a factory — hear industrial machinery.

| Property    | Type          | Description                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Region**  | region picker | Named region this sound zone covers                                   |
| **Sound**   | file picker   | Looping audio file                                                    |
| **Volume**  | slider 0–100% | Base volume at the center of the region                               |
| **Falloff** | slider        | How quickly sound fades at region edges (sharp → gradual)             |
| **Active**  | checkbox      | Whether the zone starts active (can be toggled by triggers/Lua)       |
| **Layer**   | text          | Optional layer assignment — zone activates/deactivates with its layer |

Ambient Sound Zones are **render-side only** (`ic-audio`) — they have zero sim impact and are not deterministic. They exist purely for atmosphere. The sound is spatialized: the camera's position determines what the player hears and at what volume.

Multiple overlapping zones blend naturally. A bridge over a river in a forest plays water + birds + wind, with each source fading based on camera proximity to its region.

#### EVA Notification System

EVA voice lines are how C&C communicates game events to the player — "Construction complete," "Unit lost," "Enemy approaching." The editor exposes EVA as a module for custom notifications:

| Property       | Type        | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event type** | dropdown    | `custom` / `warning` / `info` / `critical`           |
| **Text**       | text        | Notification text shown in the message area          |
| **Audio**      | file picker | Voice line audio file                                |
| **Trigger**    | connection  | When to fire the notification                        |
| **Cooldown**   | slider      | Minimum time before this notification can fire again |
| **Priority**   | dropdown    | `low` / `normal` / `high` / `critical`               |

Priority determines queuing behavior — critical notifications interrupt lower-priority ones; low-priority notifications wait. This prevents EVA spam during intense battles while ensuring critical alerts always play.

**Built-in EVA events** (game module provides defaults for standard events: unit lost, building destroyed, harvester under attack, insufficient funds, etc.). Custom EVA modules are for mission-specific notifications — "The bridge has been rigged with explosives," "Reinforcements are en route."

#### Letterbox / Cinematic Mode

The **Letterbox Mode** module toggles cinematic presentation:

- **Letterbox bars** — black bars at top and bottom of screen, creating a widescreen aspect ratio
- **HUD hidden** — sidebar, minimap, resource bar, unit selection all hidden
- **Input restricted** — player cannot issue orders (optional — some sequences allow camera panning)
- **Transition time** — bars slide in/out smoothly (configurable)

Letterbox mode is automatically entered by Cinematic Sequences when `letterbox: true` (the default). It can also be triggered independently — a Letterbox Mode module connected to a trigger enters cinematic mode for dramatic moments without a full sequence (e.g., a dramatic camera pan to a nuclear explosion, then back to gameplay).

#### Media in Campaigns

All media modules work within the campaign editor's intermission system:

- **Fullscreen video** before missions (briefing FMVs)
- **Music Playlist** per campaign node (each mission can have its own playlist, or inherit from the campaign default)
- **Dialogue with audio** in intermission screens — character portraits with voice-over
- **Ambient sound** in intermission screens (command tent ambiance, war room hum)

The campaign node properties (briefing, debriefing) support media references:

| Property           | Type             | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Briefing video** | file picker      | Optional FMV played before the mission (fullscreen) |
| **Briefing audio** | file picker      | Voice-over for text briefing (if no video)          |
| **Briefing music** | track picker     | Music playing during the briefing screen            |
| **Debrief audio**  | file picker (×N) | Per-outcome voice-over for debrief screens          |
| **Debrief video**  | file picker (×N) | Per-outcome FMV (optional)                          |

This means a campaign creator can build the full original RA experience — FMV briefing → mission with in-game radar comms → debrief with per-outcome results — entirely through the visual editor.

#### Lua Media API (Advanced)

All media modules map to Lua functions for advanced scripting. The `Media` global (OpenRA-compatible, D024) provides the baseline; IC extensions add richer control:

```lua
-- OpenRA-compatible (work identically)
Media.PlaySpeech("eva_building_captured")    -- EVA notification
Media.PlaySound("explosion_large")           -- Sound effect
Media.PlayMusic("hell_march")                -- Music track
Media.DisplayMessage("Bridge destroyed!", "warning")  -- Text message

-- IC extensions (additive)
Media.PlayVideo("briefing_03.vqa", "fullscreen", { skippable = true })
Media.PlayVideo("commander_call.mp4", "radar_comm")
Media.PlayVideo("heli_arrives.webm", "picture_in_picture")

Media.SetMusicPlaylist({ "hell_march", "grinder" }, "shuffle")
Media.SetMusicMode("dynamic")    -- switch to dynamic mood-based selection
Media.CrossfadeTo("fogger", 3.0) -- manual crossfade with duration

Media.SetAmbientZone("forest_region", "birds_wind.ogg", { volume = 0.7 })
Media.SetAmbientZone("river_region", "water_flow.ogg", { volume = 0.5 })

-- Cinematic sequence from Lua (for procedural cutscenes)
local seq = Media.CreateSequence({ skippable = true, pause_sim = true })
seq:AddStep("letterbox", { enable = true, transition = 0.5 })
seq:AddStep("camera_pan", { to = bridge_pos, duration = 3.0 })
seq:AddStep("dialogue", { speaker = "Tanya", text = "I see them.", audio = "tanya_03.wav" })
seq:AddStep("play_sound", { ref = "artillery.wav" })
seq:AddStep("camera_shake", { intensity = 0.4, duration = 0.5 })
seq:AddStep("letterbox", { enable = false, transition = 0.5 })
seq:Play()
```

The visual modules and Lua API are interchangeable — a Cinematic Sequence created in the editor generates the same data as one built in Lua. Advanced users can start with the visual editor and extend with Lua; Lua-first users get the same capabilities without the GUI.

### Preview / Test

- **Preview button** — starts the sim from current editor state. Play the mission, then return to editor. No compilation, no export, no separate process.
- **Play from cursor** — start the preview with the camera at the current editor position (Eden Editor's "play from here")
- **Speed controls** — preview at 2x/4x/8x to quickly reach later mission stages
- **Instant restart** — reset to editor state without re-entering the editor

Simple mode covers 80% of what a casual scenario creator needs. Advanced mode exposes the full power. Same data format — a mission created in Simple mode can be opened in Advanced mode and extended.

### Campaign Editor

D021 defines the campaign *system* — branching mission graphs, persistent rosters, story flags. But a system without an editor means campaigns are hand-authored YAML, which limits who can create them. The Campaign Editor makes D021's full power visual.

Every RTS editor ever shipped treats missions as isolated units. Warcraft III's World Editor came closest — it had a campaign screen with mission ordering and global variables — but even that was a flat list with linear flow. No visual branching, no state flow visualization, no intermission screens, no dialogue trees. The result: almost nobody creates custom RTS campaigns, because the tooling makes it miserable.

The Campaign Editor operates at a level above the Scenario Editor. Where the Scenario Editor zooms into one mission, the Campaign Editor zooms out to see the entire campaign structure. Double-click a mission node → the Scenario Editor opens for that mission. Back out → you're at the campaign graph again.

#### Visual Campaign Graph

The core view: missions as nodes, outcomes as directed edges.

| **Condition**     | Optional Lua expression or story flag check (e.g., `Flag.get("scientist_rescued")`) |
| **Weight**        | Probability weight when multiple edges share the same outcome (see below)           |
| **Roster filter** | Override roster carryover for this specific path                                    |

#### Randomized and Conditional Paths

D021 defines deterministic branching — outcome X always leads to mission Y. The Campaign Editor extends this with weighted and conditional edges, enabling randomized campaign structures.

**Weighted random:** When multiple edges share the same outcome, weights determine probability. The roll is seeded from the campaign save (deterministic for replays).

```yaml
# Mission 3 outcome "victory" → random next mission
transitions:
  - from_outcome: victory
    to: mission_4a_snow      # weight 40%
    weight: 40
  - from_outcome: victory
    to: mission_4b_desert    # weight 60%
    weight: 60
```

Visually in the graph editor, weighted edges show their probability and use varying line thickness.

**Conditional edges:** An edge with a condition is only eligible if the condition passes. Conditions are evaluated before weights. This enables "if you rescued the scientist, always go to the lab mission; otherwise, random between two alternatives."

**Mission pools:** A pool node represents "pick N missions from this set" — the campaign equivalent of side quests. The player gets a random subset, plays them in any order, then proceeds. Enables roguelike campaign structures.

```
┌──────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐         ┌──────────┐
│ Mission  │────────→│   Side Mission   │────────→│ Mission  │
│    3     │         │   Pool (2 of 5)  │         │    4     │
└──────────┘         │                  │         └──────────┘
                     │ ☐ Raid Supply    │
                     │ ☐ Rescue POWs    │
                     │ ☐ Sabotage Rail  │
                     │ ☐ Defend Village │
                     │ ☐ Naval Strike   │
                     └─────────────────┘
```

Mission pools are a natural fit for the persistent roster system — side missions that strengthen (or deplete) the player's forces before a major battle.

#### Classic Globe Mission Select (RA1-Style)

The original Red Alert featured a **globe screen** between certain missions — the camera zooms to a region, and the player chooses between 2-3 highlighted countries to attack next. "Do we strike Greece or Turkey?" Each choice leads to a different mission variant, and the unchosen mission is skipped. This was one of RA1's most memorable campaign features — the feeling that *you* decided where the war went next. It was also one of the things OpenRA never reproduced; OpenRA campaigns are strictly linear mission lists.

IC supports this natively. It's not a special mode — it falls out of the existing building blocks:

**How it works:** A campaign graph node has multiple outgoing edges. Instead of selecting the next mission via a text menu or automatic branching, the campaign uses a **World Map intermission** to present the choice visually. The player sees the map with highlighted regions, picks one, and that edge is taken.

```yaml
# Campaign graph — classic RA globe-style mission select
nodes:
  mission_5:
    name: "Allies Regroup"
    # After completing this mission, show the globe
    post_intermission:
      template: world-map
      config:
        zoom_to: "eastern_mediterranean"
        choices:
          - region: greece
            label: "Strike Athens"
            target_node: mission_6a_greece
            briefing_preview: "Greek resistance is weak. Take the port city."
          - region: turkey
            label: "Assault Istanbul"
            target_node: mission_6b_turkey
            briefing_preview: "Istanbul controls the straits. High risk, strategic value."
        display:
          highlight_available: true      # glow effect on selectable regions
          show_enemy_strength: true      # "Light/Medium/Heavy resistance"
          camera_animation: globe_spin   # classic RA globe spin to region

  mission_6a_greece:
    name: "Mediterranean Assault"
    # ... mission definition

  mission_6b_turkey:
    name: "Straits of War"
    # ... mission definition
```

This is a **D021 branching campaign** with a **D038 World Map intermission** as the branch selector. The campaign graph has the branching structure; the world map is just the presentation layer for the player's choice. No strategic territory tracking, no force pools, no turn-based meta-layer — just a map that asks "where do you want to fight next?"

**Comparison to World Domination:**

| Aspect                 | Globe Mission Select (RA1-style)               | World Domination                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Choose between pre-authored mission variants   | Emergent strategic territory war   |
| **Number of choices**  | 2-3 per decision point                         | All adjacent regions               |
| **Missions**           | Pre-authored (designer-created)                | Generated from strategic state     |
| **Map role**           | Presentation for a branch choice               | Primary campaign interface         |
| **Territory tracking** | None — cosmetic only                           | Full (gains, losses, garrisons)    |
| **Complexity**         | Simple — just a campaign graph + map UI        | Complex — full strategic layer     |
| **OpenRA support**     | No                                             | No                                 |
| **IC support**         | Yes — D021 graph + D038 World Map intermission | Yes — World Domination mode (D016) |

The globe mission select is the **simplest** use of the world map component — a visual branch selector for hand-crafted campaigns. World Domination is the most complex — a full strategic meta-layer. Everything in between is supported too: a map that shows your progress through a linear campaign (locations lighting up as you complete them), a map with side-mission markers, a map that shows enemy territory shrinking as you advance.

**RA1 game module default:** The Red Alert game module ships with a campaign that recreates the original RA1 globe-style mission select at the same decision points as the original game. When the original RA1 campaign asked "Greece or Turkey?", IC's RA1 campaign shows the same choice on the same map — but with IC's modern World Map renderer instead of the original 320×200 pre-rendered globe FMV.

#### Persistent State Dashboard

The biggest reason campaign creation is painful in every RTS editor: you can't see what state flows between missions. Story flags are set in Lua buried inside mission scripts. Roster carryover is configured in YAML you never visualize. Variables disappear between missions unless you manually manage them.

The **Persistent State Dashboard** makes campaign state visible and editable in the GUI.

**Roster view:**
```

| `bridge_destroyed`  | Mission 2, trigger 14 | Mission 4 (CoP), Mission 5 (briefing) | switch  |
| `scientist_rescued` | Mission 3, Lua script | Mission 4 (edge condition)            | switch  |
| `tanks_captured`    | Mission 2, debrief    | Mission 3 (roster merge)              | counter |
| `player_reputation` | Multiple missions     | Mission 6 (dialogue branches)         | counter |

**Campaign variables:** Separate from per-mission variables (Variables Panel). Campaign variables persist across ALL missions. Per-mission variables reset. The dashboard shows which scope each variable belongs to and highlights conflicts (same name in both scopes).

#### Intermission Screens

Between missions, the player sees an intermission — not just a text briefing, but a customizable screen layout. This is where campaigns become more than "mission list" and start feeling like a *game within the game*.

**Built-in intermission templates:**

| Template              | Layout                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Use Case                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Briefing Only**     | Portrait + text + "Begin Mission" button                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Simple campaigns, classic RA style            |
| **Roster Management** | Unit list with keep/dismiss, equipment assignment, formation arrangement                                                                                                                                                                                                    | OFP: Resistance style unit management         |
| **Base Screen**       | Persistent base view — spend resources on upgrades that carry forward                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Between-mission base building (C&C3 style)    |
| **Shop / Armory**     | Campaign inventory + purchase panel + currency                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RPG-style equipment management                |
| **Dialogue**          | Portrait + branching text choices (see Dialogue Editor below)                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Story-driven campaigns, RPG conversations     |
| **World Map**         | Map with mission locations — player chooses next mission from available nodes. In World Domination campaigns (D016), shows faction territories, frontlines, and the LLM-generated briefing for the next mission                                                             | Non-linear campaigns, World Domination        |
| **Debrief + Stats**   | Mission results, casualties, performance grade, story flag changes                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Post-mission feedback                         |
| **Credits**           | Auto-scrolling text with section headers, role/name columns, optional background video/image and music track. Supports contributor photos, logo display, and "special thanks" sections. Speed and style (classic scroll / paginated / cinematic) configurable per-campaign. | Campaign completion, mod credits, jam credits |
| **Custom**            | Empty canvas — arrange any combination of panels via the layout editor                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Total creative freedom                        |

Intermissions are defined per campaign node (between "finish Mission 2" and "start Mission 3"). They can chain: debrief → roster management → briefing → begin mission. A typical campaign ending chains: final debrief → credits → return to campaign select (or main menu).

**Intermission panels (building blocks):**

- **Text panel** — rich text with variable substitution (`"Commander, we lost {Var.get('casualties')} soldiers."`).
- **Portrait panel** — character portrait + name. Links to Named Characters.
- **Roster panel** — surviving units from previous mission. Player can dismiss, reorganize, assign equipment.
- **Inventory panel** — campaign-wide items. Drag onto units to equip. Purchase from shop with campaign currency.
- **Choice panel** — buttons that set story flags or campaign variables. "Execute the prisoner? [Yes] [No]" → sets `prisoner_executed` flag.
- **Map panel** — shows campaign geography. Highlights available next missions if using mission pools. In World Domination mode, renders the world map with faction-colored regions, animated frontlines, and narrative briefing panel. The LLM presents the next mission through the briefing; the player sees their territory and the story context, not a strategy game menu.
- **Stats panel** — mission performance: time, casualties, objectives completed, units destroyed.
- **Credits panel** — auto-scrolling rich text optimized for credits display. Supports section headers ("Cast," "Design," "Special Thanks"), two-column role/name layout, contributor portraits, logo images, and configurable scroll speed. The text source can be inline, loaded from a `credits.yaml` file (for reuse across campaigns), or generated dynamically via Lua. Scroll style options: `classic` (continuous upward scroll, Star Wars / RA1 style), `paginated` (fade between pages), `cinematic` (camera-tracked text over background video). Music reference plays for the duration. The panel emits a `credits_finished` event when scrolling completes — chain to a Choice panel ("Play Again?" / "Return to Menu") or auto-advance.
- **Custom Lua panel** — advanced panel that runs arbitrary Lua to generate content dynamically.

These panels compose freely. A "Base Screen" template is just a preset arrangement: roster panel on the left, inventory panel center, stats panel right, briefing text bottom. The Custom template starts empty and lets the designer arrange any combination.

**Per-player intermission variants:** In co-op campaigns, each intermission can optionally define per-player layouts. The intermission editor exposes a "Player Variant" selector: Default (all players see the same screen) or per-slot overrides (Player 1 sees layout A, Player 2 sees layout B). Per-player briefing text is always supported regardless of this setting. Per-player layouts go further — different panel arrangements, different choice options, different map highlights per player slot. This is what makes co-op campaigns feel like each player has a genuine role, not just a shared screen. Variant layouts share the same panel library; only the arrangement and content differ.

#### Dialogue Editor

Branching dialogue isn't RPG-exclusive — it's what separates a campaign with a story from a campaign that's just a mission list. "Commander, we've intercepted enemy communications. Do we attack now or wait for reinforcements?" That's a dialogue tree. The choice sets a story flag that changes the next mission's layout.

The Dialogue Editor is a visual branching tree editor, similar to tools like Twine or Ink but built into the scenario editor.

```

**Dialogue node properties:**

| Property      | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Speaker**   | Character name + portrait reference                                |
| **Text**      | Dialogue line (supports variable substitution)                     |
| **Audio**     | Optional voice-over reference                                      |
| **Choices**   | Player responses — each is an outgoing edge                        |
| **Condition** | Node only appears if condition is true (enables adaptive dialogue) |
| **Effects**   | On reaching this node: set flags, adjust variables, give items     |

**Conditional dialogue:** Nodes can have conditions — "Only show this line if `scientist_rescued` is true." This means the same dialogue tree adapts to campaign state. A character references events from earlier missions without the designer creating separate trees per path.

**Dialogue in missions:** Dialogue trees aren't limited to intermissions. They can trigger during a mission — an NPC unit triggers a dialogue when approached or when a trigger fires. The dialogue pauses the game (or runs alongside it, designer's choice) and the player's choice sets flags that affect the mission in real-time.

#### Named Characters

A **named character** is a persistent entity identity that survives across missions. Not a specific unit instance (those die) — a character definition that can have multiple appearances.

| Property          | Description                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**          | Display name ("Tanya", "Commander Volkov")                              |
| **Portrait**      | Image reference for dialogue and intermission screens                   |
| **Unit type**     | Default unit type when spawned (can change per mission)                 |
| **Traits**        | Arbitrary key-value pairs (strength, charisma, rank — designer-defined) |
| **Inventory**     | Items this character carries (from campaign inventory system)           |
| **Biography**     | Text shown in roster screen, updated by Lua as the campaign progresses  |
| **Must survive**  | If true, character death → mission failure (or specific outcome)        |
| **Death outcome** | Named outcome triggered if this character dies (e.g., `tanya_killed`)   |

Named characters bridge scenarios and intermissions. Tanya in Mission 1 is the same Tanya in Mission 5 — same veterancy, same kill count, same equipment. If she dies in Mission 3 and doesn't have "must survive," the campaign continues without her — and future dialogue trees skip her lines via conditions.

This is the primitive that makes RPG campaigns possible. A designer creates 6 named characters, gives them traits and portraits, writes dialogue between them, and lets the player manage their roster between missions. That's an RPG party in an RTS shell — no engine changes required, just creative use of the campaign editor's building blocks.

#### Campaign Inventory

Persistent items that exist at the campaign level, not within any specific mission.

| Property       | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**       | Item identifier (`prototype_chrono`, `captured_mig`)       |
| **Display**    | Name, icon, description shown in intermission screens      |
| **Quantity**   | Stack count (1 for unique items, N for consumables)        |
| **Category**   | Grouping for inventory panel (equipment, intel, resources) |
| **Effects**    | Optional Lua — what happens when used/equipped             |
| **Assignable** | Can be assigned to named characters in roster screen       |

Items are added via Lua (`Campaign.add_item("captured_mig", 1)`) or via debrief/intermission choices. They're spent, equipped, or consumed in later missions or intermissions.

Combined with named characters and the roster screen: a player captures enemy equipment in Mission 2, assigns it to a character in the intermission, and that character spawns with it in Mission 3. The system is general-purpose — "items" can be weapons, vehicles, intel documents, key cards, magical artifacts, or anything the designer defines.

#### Campaign Testing

The Campaign Editor includes tools for testing campaign flow without playing every mission to completion:

- **Graph validation** — checks for dead ends (outcomes with no outgoing edge), unreachable missions, circular paths (unless intentional), and missing mission files
- **Jump to mission** — start any mission with simulated campaign state (set flags, roster, and inventory to test a specific path)
- **Fast-forward state** — manually set campaign variables and flags to simulate having played earlier missions
- **Path coverage** — highlights which campaign paths have been test-played and which haven't. Color-coded: green (tested), yellow (partially tested), red (untested)
- **Campaign playthrough** — play the entire campaign with accelerated sim (or auto-resolve missions) to verify flow and state propagation
- **State inspector** — during preview, shows live campaign state: current flags, roster, inventory, variables, which path was taken

#### Reference Material (Campaign Editors)

The campaign editor design draws from these (in addition to the scenario editor references above):

- **Warcraft III World Editor (2002):** The closest any RTS came to campaign editing — campaign screen with mission ordering, cinematic editor, global variables persistent across maps. Still linear and limited: no visual branching, no roster management, no intermission screen customization. IC takes WC3's foundation and adds the graph, state, and intermission layers.
- **RPG Maker (1992–present):** Campaign-level persistent variables, party management, item/equipment systems, branching dialogue. Proves these systems work for non-programmers. IC adapts the persistence model for RTS context.
- **Twine / Ink (interactive fiction tools):** Visual branching narrative editors. Twine's node-and-edge graph directly inspired IC's campaign graph view. Ink's conditional text ("You remember the bridge{bridge_destroyed: 's destruction| still standing}") inspired IC's variable substitution in dialogue.
- **Heroes of Might and Magic III (1999):** Campaign with carryover — hero stats, army, artifacts persist between maps. Proved that persistent state between RTS-adjacent missions creates investment. Limited to linear ordering.
- **FTL / Slay the Spire (roguelikes):** Randomized mission path selection, persistent resources, risk/reward side missions. Inspired IC's mission pools and weighted random paths.
- **OFP: Resistance (2002):** The gold standard for persistent campaigns — surviving soldiers, captured equipment, emotional investment. Every feature in IC's campaign editor exists because OFP: Resistance proved persistent campaigns are transformative.

### Game Master Mode (Zeus-Inspired)

A real-time scenario manipulation mode where one player (the Game Master) controls the scenario while others play. Derived from the scenario editor's UI but operates on a live game.

**Use cases:**
- **Cooperative campaigns** — a human GM controls the enemy faction, placing reinforcements, directing attacks, adjusting difficulty in real-time based on how players are doing
- **Training** — a GM creates escalating challenges for new players
- **Events** — community game nights with a live GM creating surprises
- **Content testing** — mission designers test their scenarios with real players while making live adjustments

**Game Master controls:**
- Place/remove units and buildings (from a budget — prevents flooding)
- Direct AI unit groups (attack here, retreat, patrol)
- Change weather, time of day
- Trigger scripted events (reinforcements, briefings, explosions)
- Reveal/hide map areas
- Adjust resource levels
- Pause sim for dramatic reveals (if all players agree)

**Not included at launch:** Player control of individual units (RTS is about armies, not individual soldiers). The GM operates at the strategic level — directing groups, managing resources, triggering events.

**Per-player undo:** In multiplayer editing contexts (and Game Master mode specifically), undo is scoped per-actor. The GM's undo reverts only GM actions, not player orders or other players' actions. This follows Garry's Mod's per-player undo model — in a shared session, pressing undo reverts YOUR last action, not the last global action. For the single-player editor, undo is global (only one actor).

**Phase:** Game Master mode is a Phase 6b deliverable. It reuses 90% of the scenario editor's systems — the main new work is the real-time overlay UI and budget/permission system.

### Publishing

Scenarios created in the editor export as standard IC mission format (YAML map + Lua scripts + assets). They can be:
- Saved locally
- Published to Workshop (D030) with one click
- Shared as files
- Used in campaigns (D021) — or created directly in the Campaign Editor
- Assembled into full campaigns and published as campaign packs
- Loaded by the LLM for remixing (D016)

### Replay-to-Scenario Pipeline

Replays are the richest source of gameplay data in any RTS — every order, every battle, every building placement, every dramatic moment. IC already stores replays as deterministic order streams and enriches them with structured gameplay events (D031) in SQLite (D034). The Replay-to-Scenario pipeline turns that data into editable scenarios.

Replays already contain what's hardest to design from scratch: pacing, escalation, and dramatic turning points. The pipeline extracts that structure into an editable scenario skeleton — a designer adds narrative and polish on top.

#### Two Modes: Direct Extraction and LLM Generation

**Direct extraction (no LLM required):** Deterministic, mechanical conversion of replay data into editor entities. This always works, even without an LLM configured.

| Extracted Element        | Source Data                                                | Editor Result                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Map & terrain**        | Replay's initial map state                                 | Full terrain imported — tiles, resources, cliffs, water                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Starting positions**   | Initial unit/building placements per player                | Entities placed with correct faction, position, facing                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Movement paths**       | `OrderIssued` (move orders) over time                      | Waypoints along actual routes taken — patrol paths, attack routes, retreat lines                                                                                                                             |
| **Build order timeline** | `BuildingPlaced` events with tick timestamps               | Building entities with `timer_elapsed` triggers matching the original timing                                                                                                                                 |
| **Combat hotspots**      | Clusters of `CombatEngagement` events in spatial proximity | Named regions at cluster centroids — "Combat Zone 1 (2400, 1800)," "Combat Zone 2 (800, 3200)." The LLM path (below) upgrades these to human-readable names like "Bridge Assault" using map feature context. |
| **Unit composition**     | `UnitCreated` events per faction per time window           | Wave Spawner modules mimicking the original army buildup timing                                                                                                                                              |
| **Key moments**          | Spikes in event density (kills/sec, orders/sec)            | Trigger markers at dramatic moments — editor highlights them in the timeline                                                                                                                                 |
| **Resource flow**        | `HarvestDelivered` events                                  | Resource deposits and harvester assignments matching the original economy                                                                                                                                    |

The result: a scenario skeleton with correct terrain, unit placements, waypoints tracing the actual battle flow, and trigger points at dramatic moments. It's mechanically accurate but has no story — no briefing, no objectives, no dialogue. A designer opens it in the editor and adds narrative on top.

**LLM-powered generation (D016, requires LLM configured):** The LLM reads the gameplay event log and generates the narrative layer that direct extraction can't provide.

| Generated Element     | LLM Input                                             | LLM Output                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mission briefing**  | Event timeline summary, factions, map name, outcome   | "Commander, intelligence reports enemy armor massing at the river crossing..."              |
| **Objectives**        | Key events + outcome                                  | Primary: "Destroy the enemy base." Secondary: "Capture the tech center before it's razed."  |
| **Dialogue**          | Combat events, faction interactions, dramatic moments | In-mission dialogue triggered at key moments — characters react to what originally happened |
| **Difficulty curve**  | Event density over time, casualty rates               | Wave timing and composition tuned to recreate the original difficulty arc                   |
| **Story context**     | Faction composition, map geography, battle outcome    | Narrative framing that makes the mechanical events feel like a story                        |
| **Named characters**  | High-performing units (most kills, longest survival)  | Surviving units promoted to named characters with generated backstories                     |
| **Alternative paths** | What-if analysis of critical moments                  | Branch points: "What if the bridge assault failed?" → generates alternate mission variant   |

The LLM output is standard YAML + Lua — the same format as hand-crafted missions. Everything is editable in the editor. The LLM is a starting point, not a black box.

```

1. **Browse replays** — open the replay browser, select a replay (or multiple — a tournament series, a campaign run)
2. **"Create Scenario from Replay"** — button in the replay browser context menu
3. **Import settings dialog:**

| Setting                | Options                                                    | Default              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Perspective**        | Player 1's view / Player 2's view / Observer (full map)    | Player 1             |
| **Time range**         | Full replay / Custom range (tick start – tick end)         | Full replay          |
| **Extract waypoints**  | All movement / Combat movement only / Key maneuvers only   | Key maneuvers only   |
| **Combat zones**       | Mark all engagements / Major battles only (threshold)      | Major battles only   |
| **Generate narrative** | Yes (requires LLM) / No (direct extraction only)           | Yes if LLM available |
| **Difficulty**         | Match original / Easier / Harder / Let LLM tune            | Match original       |
| **Playable as**        | Player 1's faction / Player 2's faction / New player vs AI | New player vs AI     |

4. **Pipeline runs** — extraction is instant (SQL queries on the event log); LLM generation takes seconds to minutes depending on the provider
5. **Open in editor** — the scenario opens with all extracted/generated content. Everything is editable. The designer adds, removes, or modifies anything before publishing.

#### Perspective Conversion

The key design challenge: a replay is a symmetric record (both sides played). A scenario is asymmetric (the player is one side, the AI is the other). The pipeline handles this conversion:

- **"Playable as Player 1"** — Player 1's units become the player's starting forces. Player 2's units, movements, and build order become AI-controlled entities with waypoints and triggers mimicking the replay behavior.
- **"Playable as Player 2"** — reversed.
- **"New player vs AI"** — the player starts fresh. The AI follows a behavior pattern extracted from the better-performing replay side. The LLM (if available) adjusts difficulty so the mission is winnable but challenging.
- **"Observer (full map)"** — both sides are AI-controlled, recreating the entire battle as a spectacle. Useful for "historical battle" recreations of famous tournament matches.

Initial implementation targets 1v1 replays — perspective conversion maps cleanly to "one player side, one AI side." 2v2 team games work by merging each team's orders into a single AI side. FFA and larger multiplayer replays require per-faction AI assignment and are deferred to a future iteration. Observer mode is player-count-agnostic (all sides are AI-controlled regardless of player count).

#### AI Behavior Extraction

The pipeline converts a player's replay orders into AI modules that approximate the original behavior at the strategic level. The mapping is deterministic — no LLM required.

| Replay Order Type         | AI Module Generated  | Example                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Move orders               | Patrol waypoints     | Unit moved A→B→C → patrol route with 3 waypoints                                |
| Attack-move orders        | Attack-move zones    | Attack-move toward (2400, 1800) → attack-move zone centered on that area        |
| Build orders (structures) | Timed build queue    | Barracks at tick 300, War Factory at tick 600 → build triggers at those offsets |
| Unit production orders    | Wave Spawner timing  | 5 tanks produced ticks 800–1000 → Wave Spawner with matching composition        |
| Harvest orders            | Harvester assignment | 3 harvesters assigned to ore field → harvester waypoints to that resource       |

This isn't "perfectly replicate a human player" — it's "create an AI that does roughly the same thing in roughly the same order." The Probability of Presence system (per-entity randomization) can be applied on top, so replaying the scenario doesn't produce an identical experience every time.

**Crate boundary:** The extraction logic lives in `ic-ai` behind a `ReplayBehaviorExtractor` trait. `ic-editor` calls this trait to generate AI modules from replay data. `ic-game` wires the concrete implementation. This keeps `ic-editor` decoupled from AI internals — the same pattern as sim/net separation.

#### Use Cases

- **"That was an incredible game — let others experience it"** — import your best multiplayer match, add briefing and objectives, publish as a community mission
- **Tournament highlight missions** — import famous tournament replays, let players play from either side. "Can you do better than the champion?"
- **Training scenarios** — import a skilled player's replay, the new player faces an AI that follows the skilled player's build order and attack patterns
- **Campaign from history** — import a series of replays from a ladder season or clan war, LLM generates connecting narrative → instant campaign
- **Modder stress test** — import a replay with 1000+ units to create a performance benchmark scenario
- **Content creation** — streamers import viewer-submitted replays and remix them into challenge missions live

#### Batch Import: Replay Series → Campaign

Multiple replays can be imported as a connected campaign:

1. Select multiple replays (e.g., a best-of-5 tournament series)
2. Pipeline extracts each as a separate mission
3. LLM (if available) generates connecting narrative: briefings that reference previous missions, persistent characters who survive across matches, escalating stakes
4. Campaign graph auto-generated: linear (match order) or branching (win/loss → different next mission)
5. Open in Campaign Editor for refinement

This is the fastest path from "cool replays" to "playable campaign" — and it's entirely powered by existing systems (D016 + D021 + D031 + D034 + D038).

#### What This Does NOT Do

- **Perfectly reproduce a human player's micro** — AI modules approximate human behavior at the strategic level. Precise micro (target switching, spell timing, retreat feints) is not captured. The goal is "similar army, similar timing, similar aggression," not "frame-perfect recreation."
- **Work on corrupted or truncated replays** — the pipeline requires a complete event log. Partial replays produce partial scenarios (with warnings).
- **Replace mission design** — direct extraction produces a mechanical skeleton, not a polished mission. The LLM adds narrative, but a human designer's touch is what makes it feel crafted. The pipeline reduces the work from "start from scratch" to "edit and polish."

**Crate boundary for LLM integration:** `ic-editor` defines a `NarrativeGenerator` trait (input: replay event summary → output: briefing, objectives, dialogue YAML). `ic-llm` implements it. `ic-game` wires the implementation at startup — if no LLM provider is configured, the trait is backed by a no-op that skips narrative generation. `ic-editor` never imports `ic-llm` directly. This mirrors the sim/net separation: the editor knows it *can* request narrative, but has zero knowledge of how it's generated.

**Phase:** Direct extraction ships with the scenario editor in **Phase 6a** (it's just SQL queries + editor import — no new system needed). LLM-powered narrative generation ships in **Phase 7** (requires `ic-llm`). Batch campaign import is a **Phase 7** feature built on D021's campaign graph.

### Reference Material

The scenario editor design draws from:
- **OFP mission editor (2001):** Probability of Presence, triggers with countdown/timeout, Guard/Guarded By, synchronization, Easy/Advanced toggle. The gold standard for "simple, not bloated, not limiting."
- **OFP: Resistance (2002):** Persistent campaign — surviving soldiers, captured equipment, emotional investment. The campaign editor exists because Resistance proved persistent campaigns are transformative.
- **Arma 3 Eden Editor (2016):** 3D placement, modules (154 built-in), compositions, layers, Workshop integration, undo/redo
- **Arma Reforger Game Master (2022):** Budget system, real-time manipulation, controller support, simplified objectives
- **Age of Empires II Scenario Editor (1999):** Condition-effect trigger system (the RTS gold standard — 25+ years of community use), trigger areas as spatial logic. Cautionary lesson: flat trigger list collapses at scale — IC adds folders, search, and flow graph to prevent this.
- **StarCraft Campaign Editor / SCMDraft (1998+):** Named locations (spatial regions referenced by name across triggers). The "location" concept directly inspired IC's Named Regions. Also: open file format enabled community editors — validates IC's YAML approach.
- **Warcraft III World Editor:** GUI-based triggers with conditions, actions, and variables. IC's module system and Variables Panel serve the same role.
- **TimeSplitters 2/3 MapMaker (2002/2005):** Visible memory/complexity budget bar — always know what you can afford. Inspired IC's Scenario Complexity Meter.
- **Super Mario Maker (2015/2019):** Element interactions create depth without parameter bloat. Behaviors emerge from spatial arrangement. Instant build-test loop measured in seconds.
- **LittleBigPlanet 2 (2011):** Pre-packaged logic modules (drop-in game patterns). Directly inspired IC's module system. Cautionary lesson: server shutdown destroyed 10M+ creations — content survival is non-negotiable (IC uses local-first storage + Workshop export).
- **RPG Maker (1992–present):** Tiered complexity architecture (visual events → scripting). Validates IC's Simple → Advanced → Lua progression.
- **Halo Forge (2007–present):** In-game real-time editing with instant playtesting. Evolution from minimal (Halo 3) to powerful (Infinite) proves: ship simple, grow over iterations. Also: game mode prefabs (Strongholds, CTF) that designers customize — directly inspired IC's Game Mode Templates.
- **Far Cry 2 Map Editor (2008):** Terrain sculpting separated from mission logic. Proves environment creation and scenario scripting can be independent workflows.
- **Divinity: Original Sin 2 (2017):** Co-op campaign with persistent state, per-player dialogue choices that affect the shared story. Game Master mode with real-time scenario manipulation. Proved co-op campaign RPG works — and that the tooling for CREATING co-op content matters as much as the runtime support.
- **Doom community editors (1994–present):** Open data formats enable 30+ years of community tools. The WAD format's openness is why Doom modding exists — validates IC's YAML-based scenario format.
- **OpenRA map editor:** Terrain painting, resource placement, actor placement — standalone tool. IC improves by integrating a full creative toolchain in the SDK (scenario editor + asset studio + campaign editor)
- **Garry's Mod (2006–present):** Spawn menu UX (search/favorites/recents for large asset libraries) directly inspired IC's Entity Palette. Duplication system (save/share/browse entity groups) validates IC's Compositions. Per-player undo in multiplayer sessions informed IC's Game Master undo scoping. Community-built tools (Wire Mod, Expression 2) that became indistinguishable from first-party tools proved that a clean tool API matters more than shipping every tool yourself — directly inspired IC's Workshop-distributed editor plugins. Sandbox mode as the default creative environment validated IC's Sandbox template as the editor's default preview mode. Cautionary lesson: unrestricted Lua access enabled the Glue Library incident (malicious addon update) — reinforces IC's sandboxed Lua model (D004) and Workshop supply chain defenses (D030, `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerability 18)

### Multiplayer & Co-op Scenario Tools

Most RTS editors treat multiplayer as an afterthought — place some spawn points, done. Creating a proper co-op mission, a team scenario with split objectives, or a campaign playable by two friends requires hacking around the editor's single-player assumptions. IC's editor treats multiplayer and co-op as first-class authoring targets.

#### Player Slot Configuration

Every scenario has a **Player Slots panel** — the central hub for multiplayer setup.

| Property           | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slot count**     | Number of human player slots (1–8). Solo missions = 1. Co-op = 2+.               |
| **Faction**        | Which faction each slot controls (or "any" for lobby selection)                  |
| **Team**           | Team assignment (Team 1, Team 2, FFA, Configurable in lobby)                     |
| **Spawn area**     | Starting position/area per slot                                                  |
| **Starting units** | Pre-placed entities assigned to this slot                                        |
| **Color**          | Default color (overridable in lobby)                                             |
| **AI fallback**    | What happens if this slot is unfilled: AI takes over, slot disabled, or required |

The designer places entities and assigns them to player slots via the Attributes Panel — a dropdown says "belongs to Player 1 / Player 2 / Player 3 / Any." Triggers and objectives can be scoped to specific slots or shared.

#### Co-op Mission Modes

The editor supports several co-op configurations. These are set per-mission in the scenario properties:

| Mode                 | Description                                                                                               | Example                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allied Factions**  | Each player controls a separate allied faction with their own base, army, and economy                     | Player 1: Allies infantry push. Player 2: Soviet armor support.       |
| **Shared Command**   | Players share a single faction. Units can be assigned to specific players or freely controlled by anyone. | One player manages economy/production, the other commands the army.   |
| **Commander + Ops**  | One player has the base and production (Commander), the other controls field units only (Operations).     | Commander builds and sends reinforcements. Ops does all the fighting. |
| **Asymmetric**       | Players have fundamentally different gameplay. One does RTS, the other does Game Master or support roles. | Player 1 plays the mission. Player 2 controls enemy as GM.            |
| **Split Objectives** | Players have different objectives on the same map. Both must succeed for mission victory.                 | Player 1: capture the bridge. Player 2: defend the base.              |

#### Per-Player Objectives & Triggers

The key to good co-op missions: players need their own goals, not just shared ones.

- **Objective assignment** — each objective module has a "Player" dropdown: All Players, Player 1, Player 2, etc. Shared objectives require all assigned players to contribute. Per-player objectives belong to one player.
- **Trigger scoping** — triggers can fire based on a specific player's actions: "When Player 2's units enter this region" vs "When any allied unit enters this region." The trigger's faction/player filter handles this.
- **Per-player briefings** — the briefing module supports per-slot text: Player 1 sees "Commander, your objective is the bridge..." while Player 2 sees "Comrade, you will hold the flank..."
- **Split victory conditions** — the mission can require ALL players to complete their individual objectives, or ANY player, or a custom Lua condition combining them.

#### Co-op Campaigns

Co-op extends beyond individual missions into campaigns (D021). The Campaign Editor supports multi-player campaigns with these additional properties per mission node:

| Property          | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Player count**  | Min and max human players for this mission (1 for solo-compatible, 2+ for co-op) |
| **Co-op mode**    | Which mode applies (see table above)                                             |
| **Solo fallback** | How the mission plays if solo: AI ally, simplified objectives, or unavailable    |

**Shared roster management:** In persistent campaigns, the carried-forward roster is shared between co-op players. The intermission screen shows the combined roster with options for dividing control:

- **Draft** — players take turns picking units from the survivor pool (fantasy football for tanks)
- **Split by type** — infantry to Player 1, vehicles to Player 2 (configured by the scenario designer)
- **Free claim** — each player grabs what they want from the shared pool, first come first served
- **Designer-assigned** — the mission YAML specifies which named characters belong to which player slot

**Drop-in / drop-out:** If a co-op player disconnects mid-mission, their units revert to AI control (or a configurable fallback: pause, auto-extract, or continue without). Reconnection restores control.

#### Multiplayer Testing

Testing multiplayer scenarios is painful in every editor — you normally need to launch two game instances and play both yourself. IC reduces this friction:

- **Multi-slot preview** — preview the mission with AI controlling unfilled player slots. Test your co-op triggers and per-player objectives without needing a real partner.
- **Slot switching** — during preview, hot-switch between player viewpoints to verify each player's experience (camera, fog of war, objectives).
- **Network delay simulation** — preview with configurable artificial latency to catch timing-sensitive trigger issues in multiplayer.
- **Lobby preview** — see how the mission appears in the multiplayer lobby before publishing: slot configuration, team layout, map preview, description.

### Game Mode Templates

Almost every popular RTS game mode can be built with IC's existing module system + triggers + Lua. But discoverability matters — a modder shouldn't need to reinvent the Survival mode from scratch when the pattern is well-known.

**Game Mode Templates** are pre-configured scenario setups: a starting point with the right modules, triggers, variables, and victory conditions already wired. The designer customizes the specifics (which units, which map, which waves) without building the infrastructure.

**Built-in templates:**

| Template                | Inspired By                     | What's Pre-Configured                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skirmish (Standard)** | Every RTS                       | Spawn points, tech tree, resource deposits, standard victory conditions (destroy all enemy buildings)                            |
| **Survival / Horde**    | They Are Billions, CoD Zombies  | Wave Spawners with escalation, base defense zone, wave counter variable, survival timer, difficulty scaling per wave             |
| **King of the Hill**    | FPS/RTS variants                | Central capture zone, scoreboard tracking cumulative hold time per faction, configurable score-to-win                            |
| **Regicide**            | AoE2                            | King/Commander unit per player (named character, must-survive), kill the king = victory, king abilities optional                 |
| **Treaty**              | AoE2                            | No-combat timer (configurable), force peace during treaty, countdown display, auto-reveal on treaty end                          |
| **Nomad**               | AoE2                            | No starting base — each player gets only an MCV (or equivalent). Random spawn positions. Land grab gameplay.                     |
| **Empire Wars**         | AoE2 DE                         | Pre-built base per player (configurable: small/medium/large), starting army, skip early game                                     |
| **Assassination**       | StarCraft UMS                   | Commander unit per player (powerful but fragile), protect yours, kill theirs. Commander death = defeat.                          |
| **Tower Defense**       | Desktop TD, custom WC3 maps     | Pre-defined enemy paths (waypoints), restricted build zones, economy from kills, wave system with boss rounds                    |
| **Tug of War**          | WC3 custom maps                 | Automated unit spawning on timer, player controls upgrades/abilities/composition. Push the enemy back.                           |
| **Base Defense**        | They Are Billions, C&C missions | Defend a position for N minutes/waves. Pre-placed base, incoming attacks from multiple directions, escalating difficulty.        |
| **Capture the Flag**    | FPS tradition                   | Each player has a flag entity (or MCV). Steal the opponent's and return it to your base. Combines economy + raiding.             |
| **Free for All**        | Every RTS                       | 3+ players, no alliances allowed. Last player standing. Diplomacy module optional (alliances that can be broken).                |
| **Diplomacy**           | Civilization, AoE4              | FFA with dynamic alliance system. Players can propose/accept/break alliances. Shared vision opt-in. Betrayal is a game mechanic. |
| **Sandbox**             | Garry's Mod, Minecraft Creative | Unlimited resources, no enemies, no victory condition. Pure building and experimentation. Good for testing and screenshots.      |
| **Co-op Survival**      | Deep Rock Galactic, Helldivers  | Multiple human players vs escalating AI waves. Shared base. Team objectives. Difficulty scales with player count.                |
| **Sudden Death**        | Various                         | No rebuilding — if a building is destroyed, it's gone. Every engagement is high-stakes. Smaller starting armies.                 |

**Templates are starting points, not constraints.** Open a template, add your own triggers/modules/Lua, publish to Workshop. Templates save 30–60 minutes of boilerplate setup and ensure the core game mode logic is correct.

**Phasing:** Not all 17 templates ship simultaneously. **Phase 6b core set** (8 templates): Skirmish, Survival/Horde, King of the Hill, Regicide, Free for All, Co-op Survival, Sandbox, Base Defense — these cover the most common community needs and validate the template system. **Phase 7 / community-contributed** (9 templates): Treaty, Nomad, Empire Wars, Assassination, Tower Defense, Tug of War, Capture the Flag, Diplomacy, Sudden Death — these are well-defined patterns that the community can build and publish via Workshop before (or instead of) first-party implementation. Scope to what you have (Principle #6); don't ship 17 mediocre templates when 8 excellent ones plus a thriving Workshop library serves players better.

**Custom game mode templates:** Modders can create new templates and publish them to Workshop (D030). A "Zombie Survival" template, a "MOBA Lanes" template, a "RPG Quest Hub" template — the community extends the library indefinitely. Templates use the same composition + module + trigger format as everything else.

**Community tools > first-party completeness.** Garry's Mod shipped ~25 built-in tools; the community built hundreds more that matched or exceeded first-party quality — because the tool API was clean enough that addon authors could. The same philosophy applies here: ship 8 excellent templates, make the authoring format so clean that community templates are indistinguishable from built-in ones, and let Workshop do the rest. The limiting factor should be community imagination, not API complexity.

**Sandbox as default preview.** The Sandbox template (unlimited resources, no enemies, no victory condition) doubles as the default environment when the editor's Preview button is pressed without a specific scenario loaded. This follows Garry's Mod's lesson: sandbox mode is how people **learn the tools** before making real content. A zero-pressure environment where every entity and module can be tested without mission constraints.

**Templates + Co-op:** Several templates have natural co-op variants. Co-op Survival is explicit, but most templates work with 2+ players if the designer adds co-op spawn points and per-player objectives.

### Workshop-Distributed Editor Plugins

Garry's Mod's most powerful pattern: community-created tools appear alongside built-in tools in the same menu. The community doesn't just create content — they **extend the creation tools themselves.** Wire Mod and Expression 2 are the canonical examples: community-built systems that became essential editor infrastructure, indistinguishable from first-party tools.

IC supports this explicitly. Workshop-published packages can contain:

| Plugin Type             | What It Adds                                                            | Example                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Custom modules**      | New entries in the Modules panel (YAML definition + Lua implementation) | "Convoy System" module — defines waypoints + spawn + escort |
| **Custom triggers**     | New trigger condition/action types                                      | "Music trigger" — plays specific track on activation        |
| **Compositions**        | Pre-built reusable entity groups (see Compositions section)             | "Tournament 1v1 Start" — balanced spawn with resources      |
| **Game mode templates** | Complete game mode setups (see Game Mode Templates section)             | "MOBA Lanes" — 3-lane auto-spawner with towers and heroes   |
| **Editor tools**        | New editing tools and panels (Lua-based UI extensions, Phase 7)         | "Formation Arranger" — visual grid formation editor tool    |
| **Terrain brushes**     | Custom terrain painting presets                                         | "River Painter" — places water + bank tiles + bridge snaps  |

All plugin types use the tiered modding system (invariant #3): YAML for data definitions, Lua for logic, WASM for complex tools. Plugins are sandboxed — an editor plugin cannot access the filesystem, network, or sim internals beyond the editor's public API. They install via Workshop like any other resource and appear in the editor's palettes automatically.

This aligns with philosophy principle #19 ("Build for surprise — expose primitives, not just parameterized behaviors"): the module/trigger/composition system is powerful enough that community extensions can create things the engine developers never imagined.

**Phase:** Custom modules and compositions are publishable from Phase 6a (they use the existing YAML + Lua format). Custom editor tools (Lua-based UI extensions) are a Phase 7 capability that depends on the editor's Lua plugin API.

### Editor Onboarding for Veterans

The IC editor's concepts — triggers, waypoints, entities, layers — aren't new. They're the same ideas that OFP, AoE2, StarCraft, and WC3 editors have used for decades. But each editor uses different names, different hotkeys, and different workflows. A 20-year AoE2 scenario editor veteran has deep muscle memory that IC shouldn't fight — it should channel.

**"Coming From" profile (first-launch):**

When the editor opens for the first time, a non-blocking welcome panel asks: "Which editor are you most familiar with?" Options:

| Profile             | Sets Default Keybindings | Sets Terminology Hints | Sets Tutorial Path                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **New to editing**  | IC Default               | IC terms only          | Full guided tour, start with Simple mode |
| **OFP / Eden**      | F1–F7 mode switching     | OFP equivalents shown  | Skip basics, focus on RTS differences    |
| **AoE2**            | AoE2 trigger workflow    | AoE2 equivalents shown | Skip triggers, focus on Lua + modules    |
| **StarCraft / WC3** | WC3 trigger shortcuts    | Location→Region, etc.  | Skip locations, focus on compositions    |
| **Other / Skip**    | IC Default               | No hints               | Condensed overview                       |

This is a **one-time suggestion, not a lock-in.** Profile can be changed anytime in settings. All it does is set initial keybindings and toggle contextual hints.

**Customizable keybinding presets:**

Full key remapping with shipped presets:

```
IC Default   — Tab cycles modes, 1-9 entity selection, Space preview
OFP Classic  — F1-F7 modes, Enter properties, Space preview
Eden Modern  — Ctrl+1-7 modes, double-click properties, P preview
AoE2 Style   — T triggers, U units, R resources, Ctrl+C copy trigger
WC3 Style    — Ctrl+T trigger editor, Ctrl+B triggers browser
```

Not just hotkeys — mode switching behavior and right-click context menus adapt to the profile. OFP veterans expect right-click on empty ground to deselect; AoE2 veterans expect right-click to open a context menu.

**Terminology Rosetta Stone:**

A toggleable panel (or contextual tooltips) that maps IC terms to familiar ones:

| IC Term                 | OFP / Eden              | AoE2                         | StarCraft / WC3         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Region                  | Trigger (area-only)     | Trigger Area                 | Location                |
| Module                  | Module                  | Looping Trigger Pattern      | GUI Trigger Template    |
| Composition             | Composition             | (Copy-paste group)           | Template                |
| Variables Panel         | (setVariable in SQF)    | (Invisible unit on map edge) | Deaths counter / Switch |
| Inline Script           | Init field (SQF)        | —                            | Custom Script           |
| Connection              | Synchronize             | —                            | —                       |
| Layer                   | Layer                   | —                            | —                       |
| Probability of Presence | Probability of Presence | —                            | —                       |
| Named Character         | Playable unit           | Named hero (scenario)        | Named hero              |

Displayed as **tooltips on hover** — when an AoE2 veteran hovers over "Region" in the UI, a tiny tooltip says "AoE2: Trigger Area." Not blocking, not patronizing, just a quick orientation aid. Tooltips disappear after the first few uses (configurable).

**Interactive migration cheat sheets:**

Context-sensitive help that recognizes familiar patterns:

- Designer opens Variables Panel → tip: "In AoE2, you might have used invisible units placed off-screen as variables. IC has native variables — no workarounds needed."
- Designer creates first trigger → tip: "In OFP, triggers were areas on the map. IC triggers work the same way, but you can also use Regions for reusable areas across multiple triggers."
- Designer writes first Lua line → tip: "Coming from SQF? Here's a quick Lua comparison: `_myVar = 5` → `local myVar = 5`. `hint \"hello\"` → `Game.message(\"hello\")`. Full cheat sheet: Help → SQF to Lua."

These only appear once per concept. They're dismissable and disable-all with one toggle. They're not tutorials — they're translation aids.

**Scenario import (partial):**

Full import of complex scenarios from other engines is unrealistic — but partial import of the most tedious-to-recreate elements saves real time:

- **AoE2 trigger import** — parse AoE2 scenario trigger data, convert condition→effect pairs to IC triggers + modules. Not all triggers translate, but simple ones (timer, area detection, unit death) map cleanly.
- **StarCraft trigger import** — parse StarCraft triggers, convert locations to IC Regions, convert trigger conditions/actions to IC equivalents.
- **OFP mission.sqm import** — parse entity placements, trigger positions, and waypoint connections. SQF init scripts flag as "needs Lua conversion" but the spatial layout transfers.
- **OpenRA .oramap entities** — already supported by the asset pipeline (D025/D026). Editor imports the map and entity placement directly.

Import is always **best-effort** with clear reporting: "Imported 47 of 52 triggers. 5 triggers used features without IC equivalents — see import log." Better to import 90% and fix 10% than to recreate 100% from scratch.

**The 30-minute goal:** A veteran editor from ANY background should feel productive within 30 minutes. Not expert — productive. They recognize familiar concepts wearing new names, their muscle memory partially transfers via keybinding presets, and the migration cheat sheet fills the gaps. The learning curve is a gentle slope, not a cliff.

### Controller & Steam Deck Support

Steam Deck is a target platform (Invariant #10), so the editor must be usable without mouse+keyboard — but it doesn't need to be *equally* powerful. The approach: full functionality on mouse+keyboard, comfortable core workflows on controller.

- **Controller input mapping:** Left stick for cursor movement (with adjustable acceleration), right stick for camera pan/zoom. D-pad cycles editing modes. Face buttons: place (A), delete (B), properties panel (X), context menu (Y). Triggers: undo (LT), redo (RT). Bumpers: cycle selected entity type
- **Radial menus** — controller-optimized selection wheels for entity types, trigger types, and module categories (replacing mouse-dependent dropdowns)
- **Snap-to-grid** — always active on controller (optional on mouse) to compensate for lower cursor precision
- **Touch input (Steam Deck / mobile):** Tap to place, pinch to zoom, two-finger drag to pan. Long press for properties panel. Touch works as a complement to controller, not a replacement for mouse
- **Scope:** Core editing (terrain, entity placement, triggers, waypoints, modules, preview) is controller-compatible at launch. Advanced features (inline Lua editing, campaign graph wiring, dialogue tree authoring) require keyboard and are flagged in the UI: "Connect a keyboard for this feature." This is the same trade-off Eden Editor made — and Steam Deck has a built-in keyboard for occasional text entry

**Phase:** Controller input for the editor ships with Phase 6a. Touch input is Phase 7.

### Accessibility

The editor's "accessibility through layered complexity" principle applies to disability access, not just skill tiers. These features ensure the editor is usable by the widest possible audience.

**Visual accessibility:**
- **Colorblind modes** — all color-coded elements (trigger folders, layer colors, region colors, connection lines, complexity meter) use a palette designed for deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia. In addition to color, elements use distinct **shapes and patterns** (dashed vs solid lines, different node shapes) so color is never the only differentiator
- **High contrast mode** — editor UI switches to high-contrast theme with stronger borders and larger text. Toggle in editor settings
- **Scalable UI** — all editor panels respect the game's global UI scale setting (50%–200%). Editor-specific elements (attribute labels, trigger text, node labels) scale independently if needed
- **Zoom and magnification** — the isometric viewport supports arbitrary zoom levels. Combined with UI scaling, users with low vision can work at comfortable magnification

**Motor accessibility:**
- **Full keyboard navigation** — every editor operation is reachable via keyboard. Tab cycles panels, arrow keys navigate within panels, Enter confirms, Escape cancels. No operation requires mouse-only gestures
- **Adjustable click timing** — double-click speed and drag thresholds are configurable for users with reduced dexterity
- **Sticky modes** — editing modes (terrain, entity, trigger) stay active until explicitly switched, rather than requiring held modifier keys

**Cognitive accessibility:**
- **Simple/Advanced mode** (already designed) is the primary cognitive accessibility feature — it reduces the number of visible options from 30+ to ~10
- **Consistent layout** — panels don't rearrange based on context. The attributes panel is always on the right, the mode selector always on the left. Predictable layout reduces cognitive load
- **Tooltips with examples** — every field in the attributes panel has a tooltip with a concrete example, not just a description. "Probability of Presence: 75" → tooltip: "75% chance this unit exists when the mission starts. Example: set to 50 for a coin-flip ambush."

**Phase:** Colorblind modes, UI scaling, and keyboard navigation ship with Phase 6a. High contrast mode and motor accessibility refinements ship in Phase 6b–7.

> **Note:** The accessibility features above cover the **editor** UI. **Game-level accessibility** — colorblind faction colors, minimap palettes, resource differentiation, screen reader support for menus, subtitle options for EVA/briefings, and remappable controls — is a separate concern that applies to `ic-render` and `ic-ui`, not `ic-editor`. Game accessibility ships in Phase 7 (see `08-ROADMAP.md`).

### Alternatives Considered

1. **In-game editor (original design, revised by D040):** The original D038 design embedded the editor inside the game binary. Revised to SDK-separate architecture — players shouldn't see creator tools. The SDK still reuses the same Bevy rendering and sim crates, so there's no loss of live preview capability. See D040 § SDK Architecture for the full rationale.
2. **Text-only editing (YAML + Lua):** Already supported for power users and LLM generation. The visual editor is the accessibility layer on top of the same data format.
3. **Node-based visual scripting (like Unreal Blueprints):** Too complex for the casual audience. Modules + triggers cover the sweet spot. Advanced users write Lua directly. A node editor is a potential Phase 7+ community contribution.

**Phase:** Core scenario editor (terrain + entities + triggers + waypoints + modules + compositions + preview + autosave + controller input + accessibility) ships in **Phase 6a** alongside the modding SDK and full Workshop. Campaign editor (graph, state dashboard, intermissions, dialogue, named characters), game mode templates, multiplayer/co-op scenario tools, and Game Master mode ship in **Phase 6b**. Editor onboarding ("Coming From" profiles, keybinding presets, migration cheat sheets, partial import) and touch input ship in **Phase 7**. The campaign editor's graph, state dashboard, and intermission screens build on D021's campaign system (Phase 4) — the sim-side campaign engine must exist before the visual editor can drive it.

---

## D040: Asset Studio — Visual Resource Editor & Agentic Generation

**Decision:** Ship an Asset Studio as part of the IC SDK — a visual tool for browsing, viewing, editing, and generating game resources (sprites, palettes, terrain tiles, UI chrome, 3D models). Optionally agentic: modders can describe what they want and an LLM generates or modifies assets, with in-context preview and iterative refinement. The Asset Studio is a tab/mode within the SDK application alongside the scenario editor (D038) — separate from the game binary.

**Context:** The current design covers the full lifecycle *around* assets — parsing (ra-formats), runtime loading (Bevy pipeline), in-game use (ic-render), mission editing (D038), and distribution (D030 Workshop) — but nothing for the creative work of making or modifying assets. A modder who wants to create a new unit sprite, adjust a palette, or redesign menu chrome has zero tooling in our chain. They use external tools (Photoshop, GIMP, Aseprite) and manually convert. The community's most-used asset tool is XCC Mixer (a 20-year-old Windows utility for browsing .mix archives). We can do better.

Bevy does not fill this gap. Bevy's asset system handles loading and hot-reloading at runtime. The in-development Bevy Editor is a scene/entity inspector, not an art tool. No Bevy ecosystem crate provides C&C-format-aware asset editing.

**What this is NOT:** A Photoshop competitor. The Asset Studio does not provide pixel-level painting or 3D modeling. Artists use professional external tools for that. The Asset Studio handles the last mile: making assets game-ready, previewing them in context, and bridging the gap between "I have a PNG" and "it works as a unit in the game."

### SDK Architecture — Editor/Game Separation

**The IC SDK is a separate application from the game.** Normal players never see editor UI. Creators download the SDK alongside the game (or as part of the `ic` CLI toolchain). This follows the industry standard: Bethesda's Creation Kit, Valve's Hammer/Source SDK, Epic's Unreal Editor, Blizzard's StarEdit/World Editor (bundled but launches separately).

**Why separate binaries instead of in-game editor:**
- **Players aren't overwhelmed.** A player launches the game and sees: Play, Multiplayer, Replays, Settings. No "Editor" menu item they'll never use.
- **SDK can be complex without apology.** The SDK UI can have dense panels, multi-tab layouts, technical property editors. It's for creators — they expect professional tools.
- **Smaller game binary.** All editor systems, asset processing code, LLM integration, and creator UI are excluded from the game build. Players download less.
- **Industry convention.** Players expect an SDK. "Download the Creation Kit" is understood. "Open the in-game editor" confuses casual players who accidentally click it.

**Why this still works for fast iteration:**
- **"Test" button in SDK** launches `ic-game` with the current scenario/asset loaded. One click, instant playtest. Same `LocalNetwork` path as before — the preview is real gameplay.
- **Hot-reload bridge.** While the game is running from a Test launch, the SDK watches for file changes. Edit a YAML file, save → game hot-reloads. Edit a sprite, save → game picks up the new asset. The iteration loop is seconds, not minutes.
- **Shared Bevy crates.** The SDK reuses `ic-render` for its preview viewports, `ic-sim` for gameplay preview, `ic-ui` for shared components. It's the same rendering and simulation — just in a different window with different chrome.

**Crate boundary:** `ic-editor` contains all SDK functionality (scenario editor, asset studio, campaign editor, Game Master mode). It depends on `ic-render`, `ic-sim`, `ic-ui`, `ic-protocol`, `ra-formats`, and optionally `ic-llm` (via traits). `ic-game` does NOT depend on `ic-editor`. Both `ic-game` and `ic-editor` are separate binary targets in the workspace — they share library crates but produce independent executables.

**Game Master mode exception:** Game Master mode requires real-time manipulation of a live game session. The SDK connects to a running game as a special client — the Game Master's SDK sends `PlayerOrder`s through `ic-protocol` to the game's `NetworkModel`, same as any other player. The game doesn't know it's being controlled by an SDK — it receives orders. The Game Master's SDK renders its own view (top-down strategic overview, budget panel, entity palette) but the game session runs in `ic-game`. Open questions deferred to Phase 6b design: how matchmaking/lobby handles GM slots (dedicated GM slot vs. spectator-with-controls), whether GM can join mid-match, and how GM presence is communicated to players.

### Three Layers

#### Layer 1 — Asset Browser & Viewer

Browse, search, and preview every asset the engine can load. This is the XCC Mixer replacement — but integrated into a modern Bevy-based UI with live preview.

| Capability              | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Archive browser**     | Browse .mix archive contents, see file list, extract individual files or bulk export                                                               |
| **Sprite viewer**       | View .shp sprites with palette applied, animate frame sequences, scrub through frames, zoom                                                        |
| **Palette viewer**      | View .pal palettes as color grids, compare palettes side-by-side, see palette applied to any sprite                                                |
| **Terrain tile viewer** | Preview .tmp terrain tiles in grid layout, see how tiles connect                                                                                   |
| **Audio player**        | Play .aud/.wav/.ogg/.mp3 files directly, waveform visualization, spectral view, loop point markers, sample rate / bit depth / channel info display |
| **Video player**        | Play .vqa/.mp4/.webm cutscenes, frame-by-frame scrub, preview in all three display modes (fullscreen, radar_comm, picture_in_picture)              |
| **Chrome previewer**    | View UI theme sprite sheets (D032) with 9-slice visualization, see button states                                                                   |
| **3D model viewer**     | Preview GLTF/GLB models (and .vxl voxel models for future RA2 module) with rotation, lighting                                                      |
| **Asset search**        | Full-text search across all loaded assets — by filename, type, archive, tags                                                                       |
| **In-context preview**  | "Preview as unit" — see this sprite on an actual map tile. "Preview as building" — see footprint. "Preview as chrome" — see in actual menu layout. |
| **Dependency graph**    | Which assets reference this one? What does this mod override? Visual dependency tree.                                                              |

**Format support by game module:**

| Game          | Archive       | Sprites             | Models            | Palettes    | Audio          | Video      | Source                                   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| RA1 / TD      | .mix          | .shp                | —                 | .pal        | .aud           | .vqa       | EA GPL release — fully open              |
| RA2 / TS      | .mix          | .shp, .vxl (voxels) | .hva (voxel anim) | .pal        | .aud           | .bik       | Community-documented (XCC, Ares, Phobos) |
| Generals / ZH | .big          | —                   | .w3d (3D meshes)  | —           | —              | .bik       | EA GPL release — fully open              |
| OpenRA        | .oramap (ZIP) | .png                | —                 | .pal        | .wav/.ogg      | —          | Open source                              |
| IC native     | —             | .png, sprite sheets | .glb/.gltf        | .pal, .yaml | .wav/.ogg/.mp3 | .mp4/.webm | Our format                               |

**Minimal reverse engineering required.** RA1/TD and Generals/ZH are fully open-sourced by EA (GPL). RA2/TS formats are not open-sourced but have been community-documented for 20+ years — .vxl, .hva, .csf are thoroughly understood by the XCC, Ares, and Phobos projects. The `FormatRegistry` trait (D018) already anticipates per-module format loaders.

#### Layer 2 — Asset Editor

Scoped asset editing operations. Not pixel painting — structured operations on game asset types.

| Tool                        | What It Does                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Palette editor**          | Remap colors, adjust faction-color ranges, create palette variants, shift hue/saturation/brightness per range                                                        | "Make a winter palette from temperate" — shift greens to whites                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Sprite sheet organizer**  | Reorder frames, adjust animation timing, add/remove frames, composite sprite layers, set hotpoints/offsets                                                           | Import 8 PNG frames → assemble into .shp-compatible sprite sheet with correct facing rotations                                                                                                                    |
| **Chrome / theme designer** | Visual editor for D032 UI themes — drag 9-slice panels, position elements, see result live in actual menu mockup                                                     | Design a new sidebar layout: drag resource bar, build queue, minimap into position. Live preview updates.                                                                                                         |
| **Terrain tile editor**     | Create terrain tile sets — assign connectivity rules, transition tiles, cliff edges. Preview tiling on a test map.                                                   | Paint a new snow terrain set: assign which tiles connect to which edges                                                                                                                                           |
| **Import pipeline**         | Convert standard formats to game-ready assets: PNG → palette-quantized .shp, GLTF → game model with LODs, font → bitmap font sheet                                   | Drag in a 32-bit PNG → auto-quantize to .pal, preview dithering options, export as .shp                                                                                                                           |
| **Batch operations**        | Apply operations across multiple assets: bulk palette remap, bulk resize, bulk re-export                                                                             | "Remap all Soviet unit sprites to use the Tiberium Sun palette"                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Diff / compare**          | Side-by-side comparison of two versions of an asset — sprite diff, palette diff, before/after                                                                        | Compare original RA1 sprite with your modified version, pixel-diff highlighted                                                                                                                                    |
| **Video converter**         | Convert between C&C video formats (.vqa) and modern formats (.mp4, .webm). Trim, crop, resize. Subtitle overlay. Frame rate control.                                 | Record a briefing in OBS → import .mp4 → convert to .vqa for classic feel, or keep as .mp4 for modern campaigns. Extract original RA1 briefings to .mp4 for remixing in Premiere/DaVinci.                         |
| **Audio converter**         | Convert between C&C audio format (.aud) and modern formats (.wav, .ogg). Trim, normalize, fade in/out. Sample rate conversion. Batch convert entire sound libraries. | Extract all RA1 sound effects to .wav for remixing in Audacity/Reaper. Record custom EVA lines → normalize → convert to .aud for classic feel. Batch-convert a voice pack from .wav to .ogg for Workshop publish. |

**Design rule:** Every operation the Asset Studio performs produces standard output formats. Palette edits produce .pal files. Sprite operations produce .shp or sprite sheet PNGs. Chrome editing produces YAML + sprite sheet PNGs. No proprietary intermediate format — the output is always mod-ready.

#### Layer 3 — Agentic Asset Generation (D016 Extension, Phase 7)

LLM-powered asset creation for modders who have ideas but not art skills. Same BYOLLM pattern as D016 — user brings their own provider (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney API, local model), `ic-llm` routes the request.

| Capability             | How It Works                                                                      | Example                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sprite generation**  | Describe unit → LLM generates sprite sheet → preview on map → iterate             | "Soviet heavy tank, double barrel, darker than the Mammoth Tank" → generates 8-facing sprite sheet → preview as unit on map → "make the turret bigger" → re-generates |
| **Palette generation** | Describe mood/theme → LLM generates palette → preview applied to existing sprites | "Volcanic wasteland palette — reds, oranges, dark stone" → generates .pal → preview on temperate map sprites                                                          |
| **Chrome generation**  | Describe UI style → LLM generates theme elements → preview in actual menu         | "Brutalist concrete UI theme, sharp corners, red accents" → generates chrome sprite sheet → preview in sidebar                                                        |
| **Terrain generation** | Describe biome → LLM generates tile set → preview tiling                          | "Frozen tundra with ice cracks and snow drifts" → generates terrain tiles with connectivity → preview on test map                                                     |
| **Asset variation**    | Take existing asset + describe change → LLM produces variant                      | "Take this Allied Barracks and make a Nod version — darker, angular, with a scorpion emblem"                                                                          |
| **Style transfer**     | Apply visual style across asset set                                               | "Make all these units look hand-drawn like Advance Wars"                                                                                                              |

**Workflow:**
1. Describe what you want (text prompt + optional reference image)
2. LLM generates candidate(s) — multiple options when possible
3. Preview in-context (on map, in menu, as unit) — not just a floating image, but in the actual game rendering
4. Iterate: refine prompt, adjust, regenerate
5. Post-process: palette quantize, frame extract, format convert
6. Export as mod-ready asset → ready for Workshop publish

**Crate boundary:** `ic-editor` defines an `AssetGenerator` trait (input: text description + format constraints + optional reference → output: generated image data). `ic-llm` implements it by routing to the configured provider. `ic-game` wires them at startup in the SDK binary. Same pattern as `NarrativeGenerator` for the replay-to-scenario pipeline. The SDK works without an LLM — Layers 1 and 2 are fully functional. Layer 3 activates when a provider is configured.

**What the LLM does NOT replace:**
- Professional art. LLM-generated sprites are good enough for prototyping, playtesting, and small mods. Professional pixel art for a polished release still benefits from a human artist.
- Format knowledge. The LLM generates images. The Asset Studio handles palette quantization, frame extraction, sprite sheet assembly, and format conversion. The LLM doesn't need to know about .shp internals.
- Quality judgment. The modder decides if the result is good enough. The Asset Studio shows it in context so the judgment is informed.

> **See also:** D016 § "Generative Media Pipeline" extends agentic generation beyond visual assets to audio and video: voice synthesis (`VoiceProvider`), music generation (`MusicProvider`), sound FX (`SoundFxProvider`), and video/cutscene generation (`VideoProvider`). The SDK integrates these as Tier 3 Asset Studio tools alongside visual generation. All media provider types use the same BYOLLM pattern and D047 task routing.

### Menu / Chrome Design Workflow

UI themes (D032) are YAML + sprite sheets. Currently there's no visual editor — modders hand-edit coordinates and pixel offsets. The Asset Studio's chrome designer closes this gap:

1. **Load a base theme** (Classic, Remastered, Modern, or any workshop theme)
2. **Visual element editor** — see the 9-slice panels, button states, scrollbar tracks as overlays on the sprite sheet. Drag edges to resize. Click to select.
3. **Layout preview** — split view: sprite sheet on left, live menu mockup on right. Every edit updates the mockup instantly.
4. **Element properties** — per-element: padding, margins, color tint, opacity, font assignment, animation (hover/press states)
5. **Full menu preview** — "Preview as: Main Menu / Sidebar / Build Queue / Lobby / Settings" — switch between all game screens to see the theme in each context
6. **Export** — produces `theme.yaml` + sprite sheet PNG, ready for `ic mod publish`
7. **Agentic mode** — describe desired changes: "make the sidebar narrower with a brushed metal look" → LLM modifies the sprite sheet + adjusts YAML layout → preview → iterate

### Cross-Game Asset Bridge

The Asset Studio understands multiple C&C format families and can convert between them:

| Conversion                 | Direction     | Use Case                                                                                                                                                   | Phase  |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| .shp (RA1) → .png          | Export        | Extract classic sprites for editing in external tools                                                                                                      | 6a     |
| .png → .shp + .pal         | Import        | Turn modern art into classic-compatible format                                                                                                             | 6a     |
| .vxl (RA2) → .glb          | Export        | Convert RA2 voxel models to standard 3D format for editing                                                                                                 | Future |
| .glb → game model          | Import        | Import artist-created 3D models for future 3D game modules                                                                                                 | Future |
| .w3d (Generals) → .glb     | Export        | Convert Generals models for viewing and editing                                                                                                            | Future |
| .vqa → .mp4/.webm          | Export        | Extract original RA/TD cutscenes to modern formats for viewing, remixing, or re-editing in standard video tools (Premiere, DaVinci, Kdenlive)              | 6a     |
| .mp4/.webm → .vqa          | Import        | Convert custom-recorded campaign briefings/cutscenes to classic VQA format (palette-quantized, VQ-compressed) for authentic retro feel                     | 6a     |
| .mp4/.webm passthrough     | Native        | Modern video formats play natively — no conversion required. Campaign creators can use .mp4/.webm directly for briefings and radar comms.                  | 4      |
| .aud → .wav/.ogg           | Export        | Extract original RA/TD sound effects, EVA lines, and music to modern formats for remixing or editing in standard audio tools (Audacity, Reaper, FL Studio) | 6a     |
| .wav/.ogg → .aud           | Import        | Convert custom audio recordings to classic Westwood AUD format (IMA ADPCM compressed) for authentic retro sound or OpenRA mod compatibility                | 6a     |
| .wav/.ogg/.mp3 passthrough | Native        | Modern audio formats play natively — no conversion required. Mod creators can use .wav/.ogg/.mp3 directly for sound effects, music, and EVA lines.         | 3      |
| Theme YAML ↔ visual        | Bidirectional | Edit themes visually or as YAML — changes sync both ways                                                                                                   | 6a     |

**ra-formats write support:** Currently `ra-formats` is read-only (parse .mix, .shp, .pal, .vqa, .aud). The Asset Studio requires write support — generating .shp from frames, writing .pal files, encoding .vqa video, encoding .aud audio, optionally packing .mix archives. This is an additive extension to `ra-formats` (no redesign of existing parsers), but non-trivial engineering: .shp writing requires correct header generation, frame offset tables, and optional LCW/RLE compression; .vqa encoding requires VQ codebook generation and frame differencing; .aud encoding requires IMA ADPCM compression with correct `AUDHeaderType` generation and `IndexTable`/`DiffTable` lookup table application; .mix packing requires building the file index and CRC hash table. All encoders reference the EA GPL source code implementations directly (see `05-FORMATS.md` § Binary Format Codec Reference). Budget accordingly in Phase 6a.

**Video pipeline:** The game engine natively plays .mp4 and .webm via standard media decoders (platform-provided or bundled). Campaign creators can use modern formats directly — no conversion needed. The .vqa ↔ .mp4/.webm conversion in the Asset Studio is for creators who *want* the classic C&C aesthetic (palette-quantized, low-res FMV look) or who need to extract and remix original EA cutscenes. The conversion pipeline lives in `ra-formats` (VQA codec) + `ic-editor` (UI, preview, trim/crop tools). Someone recording a briefing with a webcam or screen recorder imports their .mp4, previews it in the Video Playback module's display modes (fullscreen, radar_comm, picture_in_picture), optionally converts to .vqa for retro feel, and publishes via Workshop (D030).

**Audio pipeline:** The game engine natively plays .wav, .ogg, and .mp3 via standard audio decoders (Bevy audio plugin + platform codecs). Modern formats are the recommended choice for new content — .ogg for music and voice lines (good compression, no licensing issues), .wav for short sound effects (zero decode latency). The .aud ↔ .wav/.ogg conversion in the Asset Studio is for creators who need to extract and remix original EA audio (hundreds of classic sound effects, EVA voice lines, and Hell March variations) or who want to encode custom audio in classic AUD format for OpenRA mod compatibility. The conversion pipeline lives in `ra-formats` (AUD codec — IMA ADPCM encode/decode using the original Westwood `IndexTable`/`DiffTable` from the EA GPL source) + `ic-editor` (UI, waveform preview, trim/normalize/fade tools). Someone recording custom EVA voice lines imports their .wav files, previews with waveform visualization, normalizes volume, optionally converts to .aud for classic feel or keeps as .ogg for modern mods, and publishes via Workshop (D030). Batch conversion handles entire sound libraries — extract all 200+ RA1 sound effects to .wav in one operation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Rely on external tools entirely** (Photoshop, Aseprite, XCC Mixer) — Rejected. Forces modders to learn multiple disconnected tools with no in-context preview. The "last mile" problem (PNG → game-ready .shp with correct palette, offsets, and facing rotations) is where most modders give up.
2. **Build a full art suite** (pixel editor, 3D modeler) — Rejected. Scope explosion. Aseprite and Blender exist. We handle the game-specific parts they can't.
3. **In-game asset tools** — Rejected. Same reasoning as the overall SDK separation: players shouldn't see asset editing tools. The SDK is for creators.
4. **Web-based editor** — Deferred. A browser-based asset viewer/editor is a compelling Phase 7+ goal (especially for the WASM target), but the primary tool ships as a native Bevy application in the SDK.

### Phase

- **Phase 0:** `ra-formats` delivers CLI asset inspection (dump/inspect/validate) — the text-mode precursor.
- **Phase 6a:** Asset Studio ships as part of the SDK alongside the scenario editor. Layer 1 (browser/viewer) and Layer 2 (editor) are the deliverables. Chrome designer ships alongside the UI theme system (D032).
- **Phase 7:** Layer 3 (agentic generation via `ic-llm`). Same phase as LLM text generation (D016).
- **Future:** .vxl/.hva write support (for RA2 module), .w3d viewing (for Generals module), browser-based viewer.

## D039: Engine Scope — General-Purpose Classic RTS Platform

**Decision:** Iron Curtain is a general-purpose classic RTS engine. It ships with built-in C&C game modules (Red Alert, Tiberian Dawn) as its primary content, but at the architectural level, the engine's design does not prevent building any classic RTS — from C&C to Age of Empires to StarCraft to Supreme Commander to original games.

**The framing:** Built for C&C, open to anything. C&C games and the OpenRA community remain the primary audience, the roadmap, and the compatibility target. What changes is how we think about the underlying engine: nothing in the engine core should assume a specific resource model, base building model, camera system, or UI layout. These are all game module concerns.

**What this means concretely:**
1. **Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn are built-in mods** — they ship with the engine, like OpenRA bundles RA/TD/D2K. The engine launches into RA1 by default. Other game modules are selectable from a mod menu
2. **Crate naming reflects engine identity** — engine crates use `ic-*` (Iron Curtain), not `ra-*`. The exception is `ra-formats` which genuinely reads C&C/Red Alert file formats. If someone builds an AoE game module, they'd write their own format reader
3. **`GameModule` (D018) becomes the central abstraction** — the trait defines everything that differs between RTS games: resource model, building model, camera, pathfinding implementation, UI layout, tech progression, population model
4. **OpenRA experience as a composable profile** — D019 (balance) + D032 (themes) + D033 (QoL) combine into "experience profiles." "OpenRA" is a profile: OpenRA balance values + Modern theme + OpenRA QoL conventions. "Classic RA" is another profile. Each is a valid interpretation of the same game module
5. **The C&C variety IS the architectural stress test** — across the franchise (TD, RA1, TS, RA2, Generals, C&C3, RA3, C&C4, Renegade), C&C games already span harvester/supply/streaming/zero-resource economies, sidebar/dozer/crawler building, 2D/3D cameras, grid/navmesh pathing, FPS/RTS hybrids. If the engine supports every C&C game, it inherently supports most classic RTS patterns

**What this does NOT mean:**
- We don't dilute the C&C focus. RA1 is the default module, TD ships alongside it. The roadmap doesn't change
- We don't build generic RTS features that no C&C game needs. Non-C&C capability is an architectural property, not a deliverable
- We don't de-prioritize OpenRA community compatibility. D023–D027 are still critical
- We don't build format readers for non-C&C games. That's community work on top of the engine

**Why "any classic RTS" and not "strictly C&C":**
- The C&C franchise already spans such diverse mechanics that supporting it fully means supporting most classic RTS patterns anyway
- Artificial limitations on non-C&C use would require extra code to enforce — it's harder to close doors than to leave them open
- A community member building "StarCraft in IC" exercises and validates the same `GameModule` API that a community member building "RA2 in IC" uses. Both make the engine more robust
- Westwood's philosophy was engine-first: the same engine technology powered vastly different games. IC follows this spirit
- Cancelled C&C games (Tiberium FPS, Generals 2, C&C Arena) and fan concepts exist in the space between "strictly C&C" and "any RTS" — the community should be free to explore them

**Validation from OpenRA mod ecosystem:** Three OpenRA mods serve as acid tests for game-agnostic claims (see `research/openra-mod-architecture-analysis.md` for full analysis):

- **OpenKrush (KKnD):** The most rigorous test. KKnD shares almost nothing with C&C: different resource model (oil patches, not ore), per-building production (no sidebar), different veterancy (kills-based, not XP), different terrain, 15+ proprietary binary formats with zero C&C overlap. OpenKrush replaces **16 complete mechanic modules** to make it work on OpenRA. In IC, every one of these would go through `GameModule` — validating that the trait covers the full range of game-specific concerns.
- **OpenSA (Swarm Assault):** A non-RTS-shaped game on an RTS engine — living world simulation with plant growth, creep spawners, pirate ants, colony capture. No base building, no sidebar, no harvesting. Tests whether the engine gracefully handles the *absence* of C&C systems, not just replacement.
- **d2 (Dune II):** The C&C ancestor, but with single-unit selection, concrete prerequisites, sandworm hazards, and starport variable pricing — mechanics so archaic they test backward-compatibility of the `GameModule` abstraction.

**Alternatives considered:**
- C&C-only scope (rejected — artificially limits what the community can create, while the architecture already supports broader use)
- "Any game" scope (rejected — too broad, dilutes C&C identity. Classic RTS is the right frame)
- No scope declaration (rejected — ambiguity about what game modules are welcome leads to confusion)

**Phase:** Baked into architecture from Phase 0 (via D018 and Invariant #9). This decision formalizes what D018 already implied and extends it.

## D041: Trait-Abstracted Subsystem Strategy — Beyond Networking and Pathfinding

**Decision:** Extend the `NetworkModel`/`Pathfinder`/`SpatialIndex` trait-abstraction pattern to five additional engine subsystems that carry meaningful risk of regret if hardcoded: **AI strategy, fog of war, damage resolution, ranking/matchmaking, and order validation**. Each gets a formal trait in the engine, a default implementation in the RA1 game module, and the same "costs near-zero now, prevents rewrites later" guarantee.

**Context:** The engine already trait-abstracts 14 subsystems (see inventory below, including Transport added by D054). These were designed individually — some as architectural invariants (D006 networking, D013 pathfinding), others as consequences of multi-game extensibility (D018 `GameModule`, `Renderable`, `FormatRegistry`). But several critical *algorithm-level* concerns remain hardcoded in RA1's system implementations. For data-driven concerns (weather, campaigns, achievements, themes), YAML+Lua modding provides sufficient flexibility — no trait needed. For *algorithmic* concerns, the resolution logic itself is what varies between game types and modding ambitions.

**The principle:** Abstract the *algorithm*, not the *data*. If a modder can change behavior through YAML values or Lua scripts, a trait is unnecessary overhead. If changing behavior requires replacing the *logic* — the decision-making process, the computation pipeline, the scoring formula — that's where a trait prevents a future rewrite.

### New Trait Abstractions (5)

#### 1. `AiStrategy` — Pluggable AI Decision-Making

**Problem:** `ic-ai` defines `AiPersonality` as a YAML-configurable parameter struct (aggression, tech preference, micro level) that tunes behavior within a fixed decision algorithm. This is great for balance knobs — but a modder who wants a fundamentally different AI approach (GOAP planner, Monte Carlo tree search, neural network, scripted state machine, or a tournament-specific meta-counter AI) cannot plug one in. They'd have to fork `ic-ai` or write a WASM mod that reimplements the entire AI from scratch.

**Solution:**

```rust
/// Game modules and mods implement this to provide AI opponents.
/// The default RA1 implementation uses AiPersonality-driven behavior trees.
/// Mods can provide alternatives: planning-based, neural, procedural, etc.
pub trait AiStrategy: Send + Sync {
    /// Called once per AI player per tick. Reads visible game state, emits orders.
    fn decide(
        &mut self,
        player: PlayerId,
        view: &FogFilteredView,  // only what this player can see
        tick: u64,
    ) -> Vec<PlayerOrder>;

    /// Human-readable name for lobby display.
    fn name(&self) -> &str;

    /// Difficulty tier for matchmaking/UI categorization.
    fn difficulty(&self) -> AiDifficulty;

    /// Optional: per-tick compute budget hint (microseconds).
    fn tick_budget_hint(&self) -> Option<u64>;

    // --- Event callbacks (inspired by Spring Engine + BWAPI research) ---
    // Default implementations are no-ops. AIs override what they care about.
    // Events are pushed by the engine at the same pipeline point as decide(),
    // before the decide() call — so the AI can react within the same tick.

    /// Own unit finished construction/training.
    fn on_unit_created(&mut self, _unit: EntityId, _unit_type: &str) {}
    /// Own unit destroyed.
    fn on_unit_destroyed(&mut self, _unit: EntityId, _attacker: Option<EntityId>) {}
    /// Own unit has no orders (idle).
    fn on_unit_idle(&mut self, _unit: EntityId) {}
    /// Enemy unit enters line of sight.
    fn on_enemy_spotted(&mut self, _unit: EntityId, _unit_type: &str) {}
    /// Known enemy unit destroyed.
    fn on_enemy_destroyed(&mut self, _unit: EntityId) {}
    /// Own unit taking damage.
    fn on_under_attack(&mut self, _unit: EntityId, _attacker: EntityId) {}
    /// Own building completed.
    fn on_building_complete(&mut self, _building: EntityId) {}
    /// Research/upgrade completed.
    fn on_research_complete(&mut self, _tech: &str) {}

    // --- Parameter introspection (inspired by MicroRTS research) ---
    // Enables: automated parameter tuning, UI-driven difficulty sliders,
    // tournament parameter search, AI vs AI evaluation.

    /// Expose tunable parameters for external configuration.
    fn get_parameters(&self) -> Vec<ParameterSpec> { vec![] }
    /// Set a parameter value (called by engine from YAML config or UI).
    fn set_parameter(&mut self, _name: &str, _value: i32) {}

    // --- Engine difficulty scaling (inspired by 0 A.D. + AoE2 research) ---

    /// Whether this AI uses engine-level difficulty scaling (resource bonuses,
    /// reaction delays, etc.). Default: true. Sophisticated AIs that handle
    /// difficulty internally can return false to opt out.
    fn uses_engine_difficulty_scaling(&self) -> bool { true }
}

pub enum AiDifficulty { Sandbox, Easy, Normal, Hard, Brutal, Custom(String) }

pub struct ParameterSpec {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub min_value: i32,
    pub max_value: i32,
    pub default_value: i32,
    pub current_value: i32,
}
```

**Key design points:**
- `FogFilteredView` ensures AI honesty — no maphack by default. Campaign scripts can provide an omniscient view for specific AI players via conditions.
- `AiPersonality` becomes the configuration for the *default* `AiStrategy` implementation (`PersonalityDrivenAi`), not the only way to configure AI.
- **Event callbacks** (from Spring Engine/BWAPI research, see `research/rts-ai-extensibility-survey.md`) enable reactive AI without polling. Pure `decide()`-only AI works fine (events are optional), but event-aware AI can respond immediately to threats, idle units, and scouting information. Events fire before `decide()` in the same tick, so the AI can incorporate event data into its tick decision.
- **Parameter introspection** (from MicroRTS research) enables automated parameter tuning and UI-driven difficulty sliders. Every `AiStrategy` can expose its knobs — tournament systems use this for automated parameter search, the lobby UI uses it for "Advanced AI Settings" sliders.
- **Engine difficulty scaling opt-out** (from 0 A.D. + AoE2 research) lets sophisticated AIs handle difficulty internally. Simple AIs get engine-provided resource bonuses and reaction time delays; advanced AIs that model difficulty as behavioral parameters can opt out.
- AI strategies are selectable in the lobby: "IC Default (Normal)", "IC Default (Brutal)", "Workshop: Neural Net v2.1", etc.
- WASM Tier 3 mods can provide `AiStrategy` implementations — the trait is part of the stable mod API surface.
- Lua Tier 2 mods can script lightweight AI via the existing Lua API (trigger-based). `AiStrategy` trait is for full-replacement AI, not scripted behaviors.
- Adaptive difficulty (D034 integration) is implemented inside the default strategy, not in the trait — it's an implementation detail of `PersonalityDrivenAi`.
- Determinism: `decide()` and all event callbacks are called at a fixed point in the system pipeline. All clients run the same AI with the same state → same orders. Mod-provided AI is subject to the same determinism requirements as any sim code.

**Event accumulation — `AiEventLog`:**

The engine provides an `AiEventLog` utility struct to every `AiStrategy` instance. It accumulates fog-filtered events from the callbacks above into a structured, queryable log — the "inner game event log" that D044 (LLM-enhanced AI) consumes as its primary context source. Non-LLM AI can ignore the log entirely (zero cost if `to_narrative()` is never called); LLM-based AI uses it as the bridge between simulation events and natural-language prompts.

```rust
/// Accumulates fog-filtered game events into a structured log.
/// Provided by the engine to every AiStrategy instance. Events are pushed
/// into the log when callbacks fire — the AI gets both the callback
/// AND a persistent log entry.
pub struct AiEventLog {
    entries: CircularBuffer<AiEventEntry>,  // bounded, oldest entries evicted
    capacity: usize,                        // default: 1000 entries
}

pub struct AiEventEntry {
    pub tick: u64,
    pub event_type: AiEventType,
    pub description: String,  // human/LLM-readable summary
    pub entity: Option<EntityId>,
    pub related_entity: Option<EntityId>,
}

pub enum AiEventType {
    UnitCreated, UnitDestroyed, UnitIdle,
    EnemySpotted, EnemyDestroyed,
    UnderAttack, BuildingComplete, ResearchComplete,
    StrategicUpdate,  // injected by orchestrator AI when plan changes (D044)
}

impl AiEventLog {
    /// All events since a given tick (for periodic LLM consultations).
    pub fn since(&self, tick: u64) -> &[AiEventEntry] { /* ... */ }

    /// Natural-language narrative summary — suitable for LLM prompts.
    /// Produces chronological text: "Tick 450: Enemy tank spotted near our
    /// expansion. Tick 460: Our refinery under attack by 3 enemy units."
    pub fn to_narrative(&self, since_tick: u64) -> String { /* ... */ }

    /// Structured summary — counts by event type, key entities, threat level.
    pub fn summary(&self) -> EventSummary { /* ... */ }
}
```

Key properties of the event log:
- **Fog-filtered by construction.** All entries originate from the same callback pipeline that respects `FogFilteredView` — no event reveals information the AI shouldn't have. This is the architectural guarantee the user asked for: the "action story / context" the LLM reads is honest.
- **Bounded.** Circular buffer with configurable capacity (default 1000 entries). Oldest entries are evicted. No unbounded memory growth.
- **`to_narrative(since_tick)`** generates a chronological natural-language account of events since a given tick — this is the "inner game event log / action story / context" that D044's `LlmOrchestratorAi` sends to the LLM for strategic guidance.
- **`StrategicUpdate` event type.** D044's LLM orchestrator records its own plan changes into the log, creating a complete narrative that includes both game events and AI strategic decisions.
- **Useful beyond LLM.** Debug/spectator overlays for any AI ("what does this AI know?"), D042's behavioral profile building, and replay analysis all benefit from a structured event log.
- **Zero cost if unused.** The engine pushes entries regardless (they're cheap structs), but `to_narrative()` — the expensive serialization — is only called by consumers that need it.

**Modder-selectable and modder-provided:** The `AiStrategy` trait is open — not locked to first-party implementations. This follows the same pattern as `Pathfinder` (D013/D045) and render modes (D048):
1. **Select** any registered `AiStrategy` for a mod (e.g., a Generals total conversion uses a GOAP planner instead of behavior trees)
2. **Provide** a custom `AiStrategy` via a Tier 3 WASM module and distribute it through the Workshop (D030)
3. **Use someone else's** community-created AI — declare it as a dependency in the mod manifest

Unlike pathfinders (one axis: algorithm), AI has **two orthogonal axes**: which algorithm (`AiStrategy` impl) and how hard it plays (difficulty level). See D043 for the full two-axis difficulty system.

**What we build now:** Only `PersonalityDrivenAi` (the existing YAML-configurable behavior). The trait exists from Phase 4 (when AI ships); alternative implementations are future work by us or the community.

**Phase:** Phase 4 (AI & Single Player).

#### 2. `FogProvider` — Pluggable Fog of War Computation

**Problem:** `fog_system()` is system #21 in the RA1 pipeline. It computes visibility based on unit sight ranges — but the computation algorithm is baked into the system implementation. Different game modules need different fog models: radius-based (RA1), line-of-sight with elevation raycast (RA2/TS), hex-grid fog (non-C&C mods), or even no fog at all (sandbox modes). The future fog-authoritative `NetworkModel` needs server-side fog computation that fundamentally differs from client-side — the same `FogProvider` trait would serve both.

**Solution:**

```rust
/// Game modules implement this to define how visibility is computed.
/// The engine calls this from fog_system() — the system schedules the work,
/// the provider computes the result.
pub trait FogProvider: Send + Sync {
    /// Recompute visibility for a player. Called by fog_system() each tick
    /// (or staggered per 10-PERFORMANCE.md amortization rules).
    fn update_visibility(
        &mut self,
        player: PlayerId,
        sight_sources: &[(WorldPos, SimCoord)],  // (position, sight_range) pairs
        terrain: &TerrainData,
    );

    /// Is this position visible to this player right now?
    fn is_visible(&self, player: PlayerId, pos: WorldPos) -> bool;

    /// Is this position explored (ever seen) by this player?
    fn is_explored(&self, player: PlayerId, pos: WorldPos) -> bool;

    /// Bulk query: all entity IDs visible to this player (for AI, render culling).
    fn visible_entities(&self, player: PlayerId) -> &[EntityId];
}
```

**Key design points:**
- RA1 module registers `RadiusFogProvider` — simple circle-based visibility. Fast, cache-friendly, matches original RA behavior.
- RA2/TS module would register `ElevationFogProvider` — raycasts against terrain heightmap for line-of-sight.
- Non-C&C mods could implement hex fog, cone-of-vision, or always-visible. Sandbox/debug modes: `NoFogProvider` (everything visible).
- Fog-authoritative server (`FogAuthoritativeNetwork` from D006 future architectures) reuses the same `FogProvider` on the server side to determine which entities to send to each client.
- Performance: `fog_system()` drives the amortization schedule (stagger updates per `10-PERFORMANCE.md`). The provider does the math; the system decides when to call it.
- Shroud (unexplored terrain) vs. fog (explored but not currently visible) distinction is preserved in the trait via `is_visible()` vs. `is_explored()`.

**What we build now:** Only `RadiusFogProvider`. The trait exists from Phase 2; `ElevationFogProvider` ships when RA2/TS module development begins.

**Phase:** Phase 2 (built alongside `fog_system()` in the sim).

#### 3. `DamageResolver` — Pluggable Damage Pipeline Resolution

**Problem:** D028 defines the full damage pipeline: Armament → Projectile → Warhead → Versus table → multiplier stack → Health reduction. The *data* flowing through this pipeline is deeply moddable — warheads, versus tables, modifier stacks are all YAML-configurable. But the *resolution algorithm* — the order in which shields, armor, conditions, and multipliers are applied — is hardcoded in `projectile_system()`. A game module where shields absorb before armor checks, or where sub-object targeting distributes damage across components (Generals-style), or where damage types bypass armor entirely (TS ion storms) needs a different resolution order. These aren't data changes — they're algorithmic.

**Solution:**

```rust
/// Game modules implement this to define how damage is resolved after
/// a warhead makes contact. The default RA1 implementation applies the
/// standard Versus table + modifier stack pipeline.
pub trait DamageResolver: Send + Sync {
    /// Resolve final damage from a warhead impact on a target.
    /// Called by projectile_system() after hit detection.
    fn resolve_damage(
        &self,
        warhead: &WarheadDef,
        target: &DamageTarget,
        modifiers: &StatModifiers,
        distance_from_impact: SimCoord,
    ) -> DamageResult;
}

pub struct DamageTarget {
    pub entity: EntityId,
    pub armor_type: ArmorType,
    pub current_health: i32,
    pub shield: Option<ShieldState>,  // D029 shield system
    pub conditions: Conditions,
}

pub struct DamageResult {
    pub health_damage: i32,
    pub shield_damage: i32,
    pub conditions_applied: Vec<(ConditionId, u32)>,  // condition grants from warhead
    pub overkill: i32,  // excess damage (for death effects)
}
```

**Key design points:**
- The default `StandardDamageResolver` implements the RA1 pipeline from D028: Versus table lookup → distance falloff → multiplier stack → health reduction. This handles 95% of C&C damage scenarios.
- RA2 registers `ShieldFirstDamageResolver`: absorb shield → then armor → then health. Same trait, different algorithm.
- Generals-class modules could register `SubObjectDamageResolver`: distributes damage across multiple hit zones per unit.
- The trait boundary is *after hit detection* and *before health reduction*. Projectile flight, homing, and area-of-effect detection are shared infrastructure. Only the final damage-number calculation varies.
- Warhead-applied conditions (e.g., "irradiated" from D028's composable warhead design) flow through `DamageResult.conditions_applied` — the resolver decides which conditions apply based on its game's rules.
- WASM Tier 3 mods can provide custom resolvers for total conversions.

**What we build now:** Only `StandardDamageResolver`. The trait exists from Phase 2 (ships with D028). Shield-aware resolver ships when the D029 shield system lands.

**Phase:** Phase 2 (ships with D028 damage pipeline).

#### 4. `RankingProvider` — Pluggable Rating and Matchmaking

**Problem:** The competitive infrastructure (AGENTS.md) specifies Glicko-2 ratings, but the ranking algorithm is implemented directly in the relay/tracking server with no abstraction boundary. Tournament organizers and community servers may want Elo (simpler, well-understood), TrueSkill (better for team games), or custom rating systems (handicap-adjusted, seasonal decay variants, faction-specific ratings). Since tracking servers are community-hostable and federated (D030/D037), locking the rating algorithm to Glicko-2 limits what community operators can offer.

**Solution:**

```rust
/// Tracking servers implement this to provide rating calculations.
/// The default implementation uses Glicko-2.
pub trait RankingProvider: Send + Sync {
    /// Calculate updated ratings after a match result.
    fn update_ratings(
        &mut self,
        result: &CertifiedMatchResult,
        current_ratings: &[PlayerRating],
    ) -> Vec<PlayerRating>;

    /// Estimate match quality / fairness for proposed matchmaking.
    fn match_quality(&self, team_a: &[PlayerRating], team_b: &[PlayerRating]) -> MatchQuality;

    /// Rating display for UI (e.g., "1500 ± 200" for Glicko, "Silver II" for league).
    fn display_rating(&self, rating: &PlayerRating) -> String;

    /// Algorithm identifier for interop (ratings from different algorithms aren't comparable).
    fn algorithm_id(&self) -> &str;
}

pub struct PlayerRating {
    pub player_id: PlayerId,
    pub rating: i64,        // fixed-point, algorithm-specific
    pub deviation: i64,     // uncertainty (Glicko RD, TrueSkill σ)
    pub volatility: i64,    // Glicko-2 specific; other algorithms may ignore
    pub games_played: u32,
}

pub struct MatchQuality {
    pub fairness: i32,      // 0-1000 (fixed-point), higher = more balanced
    pub estimated_draw_probability: i32,  // 0-1000 (fixed-point)
}
```

**Key design points:**
- Default: `Glicko2Provider` — well-suited for 1v1 and small teams, proven in chess and competitive gaming. Validated by Valve's CS Regional Standings (see `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § Part 4), which uses Glicko with RD fixed at 75 for team competitive play.
- Community operators provide alternatives: `EloProvider` (simpler), `TrueSkillProvider` (better team rating), or custom implementations.
- `algorithm_id()` prevents mixing ratings from different algorithms — a Glicko-2 "1800" is not an Elo "1800".
- `CertifiedMatchResult` (from relay server, D007) is the input — no self-reported results.
- Ratings stored in SQLite (D034) on the tracking server.
- The official tracking server uses Glicko-2. Community tracking servers choose their own.
- Fixed-point ratings (matching sim math conventions) — no floating-point in the ranking pipeline.

**Information content weighting (from Valve CS Regional Standings):** The `match_quality()` method returns a `MatchQuality` struct that includes an `information_content` field (0–1000, fixed-point). This parameter scales how much a match affects rating changes — low-information matches (casual, heavily mismatched, very short duration) contribute less to rating updates, while high-information matches (ranked, well-matched, full-length) contribute more. This prevents rating inflation/deflation from low-quality matches. For IC, information content is derived from: (1) game mode (ranked vs. casual), (2) player count balance (1v1 is higher information than 3v1), (3) game duration (very short games may indicate disconnection, not skill), (4) map symmetry rating (if available). See `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 4.2.

```rust
pub struct MatchQuality {
    pub fairness: i32,                // 0-1000 (fixed-point), higher = more balanced
    pub estimated_draw_probability: i32,  // 0-1000 (fixed-point)
    pub information_content: i32,     // 0-1000 (fixed-point), scales rating impact
}
```

**New player seeding (from Valve CS Regional Standings):** New players entering ranked play are seeded using a weighted combination of calibration performance and opponent quality — not placed at a flat default rating:

```rust
/// Seeding formula for new players completing calibration.
/// Inspired by Valve's CS seeding (bounty, opponent network, LAN factor).
/// IC adapts: no prize money, but the weighted-combination approach is sound.
pub struct SeedingResult {
    pub initial_rating: i64,       // Fixed-point, mapped into rating range
    pub initial_deviation: i64,    // Higher than settled players (fast convergence)
}

/// Inputs to the seeding formula:
/// - calibration_performance: win rate across calibration matches (0-1000)
/// - opponent_quality: average rating of calibration opponents (fixed-point)
/// - match_count: number of calibration matches played
/// The seed is mapped into the rating range (e.g., 800–1800 for Glicko-2).
```

This prevents the cold-start problem where a skilled player placed at 1500 stomps their way through dozens of mismatched games before reaching their true rating. Valve's system proved that even ~5–10 calibration matches with quality weighting produce a dramatically better initial placement.

**Ranking visibility thresholds (from Valve CS Regional Standings):**
- **Minimum 5 matches** to appear on leaderboards — prevents noise from one-game players.
- **Must have defeated at least 1 distinct opponent** — prevents collusion (two friends repeatedly playing each other to inflate ratings).
- **RD decay for inactivity:** `sqrt(rd² + C²*t)` where C=34.6, t=rating periods since last match. Inactive players' ratings become less certain, naturally widening their matchmaking range until they play again.

**Ranking model validation (from Valve CS Regional Standings):** The `Glicko2Provider` implementation logs **expected win probabilities alongside match results** from day one. This enables post-hoc model validation using the methodology Valve describes: (1) bin expected win rates into 5% buckets, (2) compare expected vs. observed win rates within each bucket, (3) compute Spearman's rank correlation (ρ). Valve achieved ρ = 0.98 — excellent. IC targets ρ ≥ 0.95 as a health threshold; below that triggers investigation of the rating model parameters. This data feeds into the OTEL telemetry pipeline (D031) and is visible on the Grafana dashboard for community server operators. See `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 4.5.

**What we build now:** Only `Glicko2Provider`. The trait exists from Phase 5 (when competitive infrastructure ships). Alternative providers are community work.

**Phase:** Phase 5 (Multiplayer & Competitive).

#### 5. `OrderValidator` — Explicit Per-Module Order Validation

**Problem:** D012 mandates that every order is validated inside the sim before execution, deterministically. Currently, validation is implicit — it happens inside `apply_orders()`, which is part of the game module's system pipeline. This works because `GameModule::system_pipeline()` lets each module define its own `apply_orders()` implementation. But the validation contract is informal: nothing in the architecture *requires* a game module to validate orders, or specifies what validation means. A game module that forgets validation breaks the anti-cheat guarantee (D012) silently.

**Solution:** Add `order_validator()` to the `GameModule` trait, making validation an explicit, required contract:

```rust
/// Added to GameModule trait (D018):
pub trait GameModule: Send + Sync + 'static {
    // ... existing methods ...

    /// Provide the module's order validation logic.
    /// Called by the engine before apply_orders() — not by the module's own systems.
    /// The engine enforces that ALL orders pass validation before execution.
    fn order_validator(&self) -> Box<dyn OrderValidator>;
}

/// Game modules implement this to define legal orders.
/// The engine calls this for EVERY order, EVERY tick — the game module
/// cannot accidentally skip validation.
pub trait OrderValidator: Send + Sync {
    /// Validate an order against current game state.
    /// Returns Valid or Rejected with a reason for logging/anti-cheat.
    fn validate(
        &self,
        player: PlayerId,
        order: &PlayerOrder,
        state: &SimReadView,
    ) -> OrderValidity;
}

pub enum OrderValidity {
    Valid,
    Rejected(RejectionReason),
}

pub enum RejectionReason {
    NotOwner,
    InsufficientFunds,
    MissingPrerequisite,
    InvalidPlacement,
    CooldownActive,
    InvalidTarget,
    RateLimited,       // OrderBudget exceeded (D006 security)
    Custom(String),    // game-module-specific reasons
}
```

**Key design points:**
- The engine (not the game module) calls `validate()` before `apply_orders()`. This means a game module *cannot* skip validation — the architecture enforces D012's anti-cheat guarantee.
- `SimReadView` is a read-only view of sim state — the validator cannot mutate game state.
- `RejectionReason` includes standard reasons (shared across all game modules) plus `Custom` for game-specific rules.
- Repeated rejections from the same player are logged for anti-cheat pattern detection (existing D012 design, now formalized).
- The default RA1 implementation validates ownership, affordability, prerequisites, placement rules, and rate limits. RA2 would add superweapon authorization, garrison capacity checks, etc.
- This is the lowest-risk trait in the set — it formalizes what `apply_orders()` already does informally. The cost is moving validation from "inside the first system" to "explicit engine-level contract."

**What we build now:** RA1 `StandardOrderValidator`. The trait exists from Phase 2.

**Phase:** Phase 2 (ships with `apply_orders()`).

### Cost/Benefit Analysis

| Trait             | Cost Now                                  | Prevents Later                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AiStrategy`      | One trait + `PersonalityDrivenAi` wrapper | Community AI cannot plug in without forking ic-ai                                                          |
| `FogProvider`     | One trait + `RadiusFogProvider`           | RA2 elevation fog requires rewriting fog_system(); fog-authoritative server requires separate fog codebase |
| `DamageResolver`  | One trait + `StandardDamageResolver`      | Shield/sub-object games require rewriting projectile_system()                                              |
| `RankingProvider` | One trait + `Glicko2Provider`             | Community tracking servers stuck with one rating algorithm                                                 |
| `OrderValidator`  | One trait + explicit validate() call      | Game modules can silently skip validation; anti-cheat guarantee is informal                                |

All five follow the established pattern: **one trait definition, one default implementation, zero overhead** (Rust monomorphizes single-impl traits to direct calls). The architectural cost is 5 trait definitions (~50 lines total) and 5 wrapper implementations (~200 lines total). The benefit is that none of these subsystems becomes a rewrite-required bottleneck when game modules, mods, or community servers need different behavior.

### What Does NOT Need a Trait

These subsystems are already sufficiently modular through data-driven design (YAML/Lua/WASM):

| Subsystem              | Why No Trait Needed                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weather (D022)         | State machine defined in YAML, transitions driven by Lua. Algorithm is trivial; data is everything.         |
| Campaign (D021)        | Graph structure in YAML, logic in Lua. The campaign engine runs any graph; no algorithmic variation needed. |
| Achievements (D036)    | Definitions in YAML, triggers in Lua. Storage in SQLite. No algorithm to swap.                              |
| UI Themes (D032)       | Pure YAML + sprite sheets. No computation to abstract.                                                      |
| QoL Toggles (D033)     | YAML config flags. Each toggle is a sim-affecting or client-only boolean.                                   |
| Audio (P003)           | Bevy abstracts the audio backend. `ic-audio` is a Bevy plugin, not an algorithm.                            |
| Balance Presets (D019) | YAML rule sets. Switching preset = loading different YAML.                                                  |

The distinction: **traits abstract algorithms; YAML/Lua abstracts data and behavior parameters.** A damage *formula* is an algorithm (trait). A damage *value* is data (YAML). An AI *decision process* is an algorithm (trait). An AI *aggression level* is a parameter (YAML).

**Alternatives considered:**
- Trait-abstract everything (rejected — unnecessary overhead for data-driven systems; violates D015's "no speculative abstractions" principle from D018)
- Trait-abstract nothing new (rejected — the 5 identified systems carry real risk of regret; the `NetworkModel` pattern has proven its value; the cost is near-zero)
- Abstract only AI and fog (rejected — damage resolution and ranking carry comparable risk, and `OrderValidator` formalizes an existing implicit contract)

**Relationship to existing decisions:**
- Extends D006's philosophy ("pluggable via trait") to 5 new subsystems
- Extends D013's pattern ("trait-abstracted, default impl first") identically
- Extends D018's `GameModule` trait with `order_validator()`
- Supports D028 (damage pipeline) by abstracting the resolution step
- Supports D029 (shield system) by allowing shield-first damage resolution
- Supports future fog-authoritative server (D006 future architecture)
- Extended by D054 (Transport trait, SignatureScheme enum, SnapshotCodec version dispatch) — one additional trait and two version-dispatched mechanisms identified by architecture switchability audit

**Phase:** Trait definitions exist from the phase each subsystem ships (Phase 2–5). Alternative implementations are future work.

## D042: Player Behavioral Profiles & Training System — The Black Box

**Status:** Accepted
**Scope:** `ic-ai`, `ic-ui`, `ic-llm` (optional), `ic-sim` (read-only), D034 SQLite extension
**Phase:** Core profiles + quick training: Phase 4–5. LLM coaching loop: Phase 7.

### The Problem

Every gameplay session generates rich structured data (D031 `GameplayEvent` stream, D034 SQLite storage). Today this data feeds:
- Post-game stats and career analytics (`ic-ui`)
- Adaptive AI difficulty and counter-strategy (`ic-ai`, between-game queries)
- LLM personalization: coaching suggestions, post-match commentary, rivalry narratives (`ic-llm`, optional)
- Replay-to-scenario pipeline: extract one replay's behavior into AI modules (`ic-editor` + `ic-ai`, D038)

But three capabilities are missing:

1. **Aggregated player style profiles.** The replay-to-scenario pipeline extracts behavior from *one* replay. The adaptive AI mentions "per-player gameplay patterns" but only for difficulty tuning, not for creating a reusable AI opponent. There's no cross-game model that captures *how a specific player tends to play* — their preferred build orders, timing windows, unit composition habits, engagement style, faction tendencies — aggregated from all recorded games.

2. **Quick training mode.** Training against a human's style currently requires the full scenario editor pipeline (import replay → configure extraction → save → play). There's no "pick an opponent from your match history and play against their style on any map right now" flow.

3. **Iterative training loop with progress tracking.** Coaching suggestions exist as one-off readouts. There's no structured system for: play → get coached → play again with targeted AI → measure improvement → repeat. No weakness tracking over time.

### The Black Box Concept

Every match produces a *flight recorder* — a structured event log informative enough that an AI system (rule-based or LLM) can reconstruct:
- **What happened** — build timelines, army compositions, engagement sequences, resource curves
- **How the player plays** — timing patterns, aggression level, unit preferences, micro tendencies, strategic habits
- **Where the player struggles** — loss patterns, weaknesses by faction/map/timing, unit types with poor survival rates

The gameplay event stream (D031) already captures this data. D042 adds the systems that *interpret* it: profile building, profile-driven AI, and a training workflow that uses both.

### Player Style Profiles

A `PlayerStyleProfile` aggregates gameplay patterns across multiple games into a reusable behavioral model:

```rust
/// Aggregated behavioral model built from gameplay event history.
/// Drives StyleDrivenAi and training recommendations.
pub struct PlayerStyleProfile {
    pub player_id: HashedPlayerId,
    pub games_analyzed: u32,
    pub last_updated: Timestamp,

    // Strategic tendencies (averages across games)
    pub preferred_factions: Vec<(String, f32)>,         // faction → usage rate
    pub avg_expansion_timing: FixedPoint,               // ticks until first expansion
    pub avg_first_attack_timing: FixedPoint,            // ticks until first offensive
    pub build_order_templates: Vec<BuildOrderTemplate>, // most common opening sequences
    pub unit_composition_profile: UnitCompositionProfile, // preferred unit mix by game phase
    pub aggression_index: FixedPoint,                   // 0.0 = turtle, 1.0 = all-in rusher
    pub tech_priority: TechPriority,                    // rush / balanced / fast-tech
    pub resource_efficiency: FixedPoint,                // avg resource utilization rate
    pub micro_intensity: FixedPoint,                    // orders-per-unit-per-minute

    // Engagement patterns
    pub preferred_attack_directions: Vec<MapQuadrant>,  // where they tend to attack from
    pub retreat_threshold: FixedPoint,                  // health % at which units disengage
    pub multi_prong_frequency: FixedPoint,              // how often they split forces

    // Weakness indicators (for training)
    pub loss_patterns: Vec<LossPattern>,                // recurring causes of defeat
    pub weak_matchups: Vec<(String, FixedPoint)>,       // faction/strategy → loss rate
    pub underused_counters: Vec<String>,                // unit types available but rarely built
}
```

**How profiles are built:**
- `ic-ai` runs aggregation queries against the SQLite `gameplay_events` and `match_players` tables at profile-build time (not during matches)
- Profile building is triggered after each completed match and cached in a new `player_profiles` SQLite table
- For the local player: full data from all local games
- For opponents: data reconstructed from matches where you were a participant — you can only model players you've actually played against, using the events visible in those shared sessions

**Privacy:** Opponent profiles are built entirely from your local replay data. No data is fetched from other players' machines. You see their behavior *from your games with them*, not from their solo play. No profile data is exported or shared unless the player explicitly opts in.

#### SQLite Extension (D034)

```sql
-- Player style profiles (D042 — cached aggregated behavior models)
CREATE TABLE player_profiles (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id_hash  TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- hashed player identifier
    display_name    TEXT,                  -- last known display name
    games_analyzed  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    last_updated    TEXT NOT NULL,
    profile_json    TEXT NOT NULL,         -- serialized PlayerStyleProfile
    is_local        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0  -- 1 for the local player's own profile
);

-- Training session tracking (D042 — iterative improvement measurement)
CREATE TABLE training_sessions (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    started_at      TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_weakness TEXT NOT NULL,         -- what weakness this session targets
    opponent_profile TEXT,                 -- player_id_hash of the style being trained against
    map_name        TEXT NOT NULL,
    result          TEXT,                  -- 'victory', 'defeat', null if incomplete
    duration_ticks  INTEGER,
    weakness_score_before REAL,            -- measured weakness metric before session
    weakness_score_after  REAL,            -- measured weakness metric after session
    notes_json      TEXT                   -- LLM-generated or rule-based coaching notes
);
```

### Style-Driven AI

A new `AiStrategy` implementation (extends D041) that reads a `PlayerStyleProfile` and approximates that player's behavior:

```rust
/// AI strategy that mimics a specific player's style from their profile.
pub struct StyleDrivenAi {
    profile: PlayerStyleProfile,
    variance: FixedPoint,  // 0.0 = exact reproduction, 1.0 = loose approximation
    difficulty_scale: FixedPoint,  // adjusts execution speed/accuracy
}

impl AiStrategy for StyleDrivenAi {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "style_driven" }

    fn decide(&self, world: &World, player: PlayerId, budget: &mut TickBudget) -> Vec<PlayerOrder> {
        // 1. Check game phase (opening / mid / late) from tick count + base count
        // 2. Select build order template from profile.build_order_templates
        //    (with variance: slight timing jitter, occasional substitution)
        // 3. Match unit composition targets from profile.unit_composition_profile
        // 4. Engagement decisions use profile.aggression_index and retreat_threshold
        // 5. Attack timing follows profile.avg_first_attack_timing (± variance)
        // 6. Multi-prong attacks at profile.multi_prong_frequency rate
        todo!()
    }

    fn difficulty(&self) -> AiDifficulty { AiDifficulty::Custom }
    fn tick_budget_hint(&self) -> Duration { Duration::from_micros(200) }
}
```

**Relationship to existing `ReplayBehaviorExtractor` (D038):** The extractor converts one replay into scripted AI waypoints/triggers (deterministic, frame-level). `StyleDrivenAi` is different — it reads an aggregated *profile* and makes real-time decisions based on tendencies, not a fixed script. The extractor says "at tick 300, build a Barracks at (120, 45)." `StyleDrivenAi` says "this player tends to build a Barracks within the first 250–350 ticks, usually near their War Factory" — then adapts to the actual game state. Both are useful:

| System                           | Input                           | Output                                          | Fidelity                                    | Replayability                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ReplayBehaviorExtractor` (D038) | One replay file                 | Scripted AI modules (waypoints, timed triggers) | High — frame-level reproduction of one game | Low — same script every time (mitigated by Probability of Presence)   |
| `StyleDrivenAi` (D042)           | Aggregated `PlayerStyleProfile` | Real-time AI decisions based on tendencies      | Medium — captures style, not exact moves    | High — different every game because it reacts to the actual situation |

### Quick Training Mode

A streamlined UI flow that bypasses the scenario editor entirely:

**"Train Against" flow:**
1. Open match history or player profile screen
2. Click "Train Against \[Player Name\]" on any opponent you've encountered
3. Pick a map (or let the system choose one matching your weak matchups)
4. The engine generates a temporary scenario: your starting position + `StyleDrivenAi` loaded with that opponent's profile
5. Play immediately — no editor, no saving, no publishing

**"Challenge My Weakness" flow:**
1. Open training menu (accessible from main menu)
2. System shows your weakness summary: "You lose 68% of games against Allied air rushes" / "Your expansion timing is slow (6:30 vs. 4:15 average)"
3. Click a weakness → system auto-generates a training scenario:
   - Selects a map that exposes the weakness (e.g., map with air-favorable terrain)
   - Configures AI to exploit that specific weakness (aggressive air build)
   - Sets appropriate difficulty (slightly above your current level)
4. Play → post-match summary highlights whether the weakness improved

**Implementation:**
- `ic-ui` provides the training screens (match history integration, weakness display, map picker)
- `ic-ai` provides `StyleDrivenAi` + weakness analysis queries + temporary scenario generation
- No `ic-editor` dependency — training scenarios are generated programmatically and never saved to disk (unless the player explicitly exports them)
- The temporary scenario uses the same sim infrastructure as any skirmish — `LocalNetwork` (D006), standard map loading, standard game loop

### Iterative Training Loop

Training isn't one session — it's a cycle with tracked progress:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Analyze        │────▶│  Train           │────▶│  Review         │
│  (identify      │     │  (play targeted  │     │  (measure       │
│  weaknesses)    │     │  session)        │     │  improvement)   │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
        ▲                                                │
        └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         next cycle
```

**Without LLM (always available):**
- Weakness identification: rule-based analysis of `gameplay_events` aggregates — loss rate by faction/map/timing window, unit survival rates, resource efficiency compared to wins
- Training scenario generation: map + AI configuration targeting the weakness
- Progress tracking: `training_sessions` table records before/after weakness scores per area
- Post-session summary: structured stats comparison ("Your anti-air unit production increased from 2.1 to 4.3 per game. Survival rate against air improved 12%.")

**With LLM (optional, BYOLLM — D016):**
- Natural language training plans: "Week 1: Focus on expansion timing. Session 1: Practice fast expansion against passive AI. Session 2: Defend early rush while expanding. Session 3: Full game with aggressive opponent."
- Post-session coaching: "You expanded at 4:45 this time — 90 seconds faster than your average. But you over-invested in base defense, delaying your tank push by 2 minutes. Next session, try lighter defenses."
- Contextual tips during weakness review: "PlayerX always opens with two Barracks into Ranger rush. Build a Pillbox at your choke point before your second Refinery."
- LLM reads `training_sessions` history to track multi-session arcs: "Over 5 sessions, your anti-air response time improved from 45s to 18s. Let's move on to defending naval harassment."

### What This Is NOT

- **Not machine learning during gameplay.** All profile building and analysis happens between sessions, reading SQLite. The sim remains deterministic (invariant #1).
- **Not a replay bot.** `StyleDrivenAi` makes real-time strategic decisions informed by tendencies, not a frame-by-frame replay script. It adapts to the actual game state.
- **Not surveillance.** Opponent profiles are built from your local data only. You cannot fetch another player's solo games, ranked history, or private matches. You model what you've seen firsthand.
- **Not required.** The training system is entirely optional. Players can ignore it and play skirmish/multiplayer normally. No game mode requires a profile to exist.

### Crate Boundaries

| Component                                                 | Crate             | Reason                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PlayerStyleProfile` struct                               | `ic-ai`           | Behavioral model — part of AI system                     |
| `StyleDrivenAi` (AiStrategy impl)                         | `ic-ai`           | AI decision-making logic                                 |
| Profile aggregation queries                               | `ic-ai`           | Reads SQLite `gameplay_events` + `match_players`         |
| Training UI (match history, weakness display, map picker) | `ic-ui`           | Player-facing screens                                    |
| Temporary scenario generation                             | `ic-ai`           | Programmatic scenario setup without `ic-editor`          |
| Training session recording                                | `ic-ui` + `ic-ai` | Writes `training_sessions` to SQLite after each session  |
| LLM coaching + training plans                             | `ic-llm`          | Optional — reads `training_sessions` + `player_profiles` |
| SQLite schema (`player_profiles`, `training_sessions`)    | `ic-game`         | Schema migration on startup, like all D034 tables        |

`ic-editor` is NOT involved in quick training mode. The scenario editor's replay-to-scenario pipeline (D038) remains separate — it's for creating publishable community content, not ephemeral training matches.

### Consumers of Player Data (D034 Extension)

Two new rows for the D034 consumer table:

| Consumer                  | Crate             | What it reads                                             | What it produces                                                                    | Required?                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Player style profiles** | `ic-ai`           | `gameplay_events`, `match_players`, `matches`             | `player_profiles` table — aggregated behavioral models for local player + opponents | Always on (profile building) |
| **Training system**       | `ic-ai` + `ic-ui` | `player_profiles`, `training_sessions`, `gameplay_events` | Quick training scenarios, weakness analysis, progress tracking                      | Always on (training UI)      |

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D031 (telemetry):** Gameplay events are the raw data. D042 adds interpretation — the `GameplayEvent` stream is the black box recorder; the profile builder is the flight data analyst.
- **D034 (SQLite):** Two new tables (`player_profiles`, `training_sessions`). Same patterns: schema migration, read-only consumers, local-first.
- **D038 (replay-to-scenario):** Complementary, not overlapping. D038 extracts one replay into a publishable scenario. D042 aggregates many games into a live AI personality. D038 produces scripts; D042 produces strategies.
- **D041 (trait abstraction):** `StyleDrivenAi` implements the `AiStrategy` trait. Same plug-in pattern — the engine doesn't know it's running a profile-driven AI vs. a scripted one.
- **D016 (BYOLLM):** LLM coaching is optional. Without it, the rule-based weakness identification and structured summary system works standalone.
- **D010 (snapshots):** Training sessions use standard sim snapshots for save/restore. No special infrastructure needed.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                                              | Why Not                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML model trained on replays (neural-net opponent)        | Too complex, non-deterministic, opaque behavior, requires GPU inference during gameplay. Profile-driven rule selection is transparent and runs in microseconds.                                                |
| Server-side profile building                             | Conflicts with local-first principle. Opponent profiles come from your replays, not a central database. Server could aggregate opt-in community profiles in the future, but the base system is entirely local. |
| Manual profile creation ("custom AI personality editor") | Useful but separate. D042 is about automated profile extraction. A manual personality editor is a future nice-to-have that reads/writes the same `PlayerStyleProfile` struct — the systems compose.            |
| Integrate training into scenario editor only             | Too much friction for casual training. The editor is for content creation; training is a play mode. Different UX goals.                                                                                        |

**Phase:** Profile building infrastructure ships in **Phase 4** (available for single-player training against AI tendencies). Opponent profile building and "Train Against" flow ship in **Phase 5** (requires multiplayer match data). LLM coaching loop ships in **Phase 7** (optional BYOLLM). The `training_sessions` table and progress tracking ship alongside the training UI in Phase 4–5.

## D043: AI Behavior Presets — Classic, OpenRA, and IC Default

**Status:** Accepted
**Scope:** `ic-ai`, `ic-sim` (read-only), game module configuration
**Phase:** Phase 4 (ships with AI & Single Player)

### The Problem

D019 gives players switchable *balance* presets (Classic RA vs. OpenRA vs. Remastered values). D041 provides the `AiStrategy` trait for pluggable AI algorithms. But neither addresses a parallel concern: AI *behavioral* style. Original Red Alert AI, OpenRA AI, and a research-informed IC AI all make fundamentally different decisions given the same balance values. A player who selects "Classic RA" balance expects an AI that *plays like Classic RA* — predictable build orders, minimal micro, base-walk expansion, no focus-fire — not an advanced AI that happens to use 1996 damage tables.

### Decision

Ship **AI behavior presets** as first-class configurations alongside balance presets (D019). Each preset defines how the AI plays — its decision-making style, micro level, strategic patterns, and quirks — independent of which balance values or pathfinding behavior are active.

### Built-In Presets

| Preset         | Behavior Description                                                                                                                                                   | Source                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Classic RA** | Mimics original RA AI quirks: predictable build queues, base-walk expansion, minimal unit micro, no focus-fire, doesn't scout, doesn't adapt to player strategy        | EA Red Alert source code analysis       |
| **OpenRA**     | Matches OpenRA skirmish AI: better micro, uses attack-move, scouts, adapts build to counter player's army composition, respects fog of war properly                    | OpenRA AI implementation analysis       |
| **IC Default** | Research-informed enhanced AI: flowfield-aware group tactics, proper formation movement, multi-prong attacks, economic harassment, tech-switching, adaptive aggression | Open-source RTS AI research (see below) |

### IC Default AI — Research Foundation

The IC Default preset draws from published research and open-source implementations across the RTS genre:

- **0 A.D.** — economic AI with resource balancing heuristics, expansion timing models
- **Spring Engine (BAR/Zero-K)** — group micro, terrain-aware positioning, retreat mechanics, formation movement
- **Wargus (Stratagus)** — Warcraft II AI with build-order scripting and adaptive counter-play
- **OpenRA** — the strongest open-source C&C AI; baseline for improvement
- **MicroRTS / AIIDE competitions** — academic RTS AI research: MCTS-based planning, influence maps, potential fields for tactical positioning
- **StarCraft: Brood War AI competitions (SSCAIT, AIIDE)** — decades of research on build-order optimization, scouting, harassment timing

The IC Default AI is not a simple difficulty bump — it's a qualitatively different decision process. Where Classic RA groups all units and attack-moves to the enemy base, IC Default maintains map control, denies expansions, and probes for weaknesses before committing.

### IC Default AI — Implementation Architecture

Based on cross-project analysis of EA Red Alert, EA Generals/Zero Hour, OpenRA, 0 A.D. Petra, Spring Engine, MicroRTS, and Stratagus (see `research/rts-ai-implementation-survey.md` and `research/stratagus-stargus-opencraft-analysis.md`), `PersonalityDrivenAi` uses a **priority-based manager hierarchy** — the dominant pattern across all surveyed RTS AI implementations (independently confirmed in 7 codebases):

```
PersonalityDrivenAi → AiStrategy trait impl
├── EconomyManager
│   ├── HarvesterController     (nearest-resource assignment, danger avoidance)
│   ├── PowerMonitor            (urgency-based power plant construction)
│   └── ExpansionPlanner        (economic triggers for new base timing)
├── ProductionManager
│   ├── UnitCompositionTarget   (share-based, self-correcting — from OpenRA)
│   ├── BuildOrderEvaluator     (priority queue with urgency — from Petra)
│   └── StructurePlanner        (influence-map placement — from 0 A.D.)
├── MilitaryManager
│   ├── AttackPlanner           (composition thresholds + timing — from Petra)
│   ├── DefenseResponder        (event-driven reactive defense — from OpenRA)
│   └── SquadManager            (unit grouping, assignment, retreat)
└── AiState (shared)
    ├── ThreatMap               (influence map: enemy unit positions + DPS)
    ├── ResourceMap             (known resource node locations and status)
    ├── ScoutingMemory          (last-seen timestamps for enemy buildings)
    └── StrategyClassification  (Phase 5+: opponent archetype tracking)
```

Each manager runs on its own tick-gated schedule (see Performance Budget below). Managers communicate through shared `AiState`, not direct calls — the same pattern used by 0 A.D. Petra and OpenRA's modular bot architecture.

#### Key Techniques (Phase 4)

These six techniques form the Phase 4 implementation. Each is proven across multiple surveyed projects:

1. **Priority-based resource allocation** (from Petra's `QueueManager`) — single most impactful pattern. Build requests go into a priority queue ordered by urgency. Power plant at 90% capacity is urgent; third barracks is not. Prevents the "AI has 50k credits and no power" failure mode seen in EA Red Alert.

2. **Share-based unit composition** (from OpenRA's `UnitBuilderBotModule`) — production targets expressed as ratios (e.g., infantry 40%, vehicles 50%, air 10%). Each production cycle builds whatever unit type is furthest below its target share. Self-correcting: losing tanks naturally shifts production toward tanks. Personality parameters (D043 YAML config) tune the ratios per preset.

3. **Influence map for building placement** (from 0 A.D. Petra) — a grid overlay scoring each cell by proximity to resources, distance from known threats, and connectivity to existing base. Dramatically better base layouts than EA RA's random placement. The influence map is a fixed-size array in `AiScratch`, cleared and rebuilt on the building-placement schedule.

4. **Tick-gated evaluation** (from Generals/Petra/MicroRTS) — expensive decisions run infrequently, cheap ones run often. Defense response is near-instant (every tick, event-driven). Strategic reassessment is every 60 ticks (~2 seconds). This pattern appears in *every* surveyed project that handles 200+ units. See Performance Budget table below.

5. **Fuzzy engagement logic** (from OpenRA's `AttackOrFleeFuzzy`) — combat decisions use fuzzy membership functions over health ratio, relative DPS, and nearby ally strength, producing a continuous attack↔retreat score rather than a binary threshold. This avoids the "oscillating dance" where units alternate between attacking and fleeing at a hard HP boundary.

6. **Computation budget cap** (from MicroRTS) — `AiStrategy::tick_budget_hint()` (D041) returns a microsecond budget. The AI *must* return within this budget, even if evaluation is incomplete — partial results are better than frame stalls. The manager hierarchy makes this natural: if the budget is exhausted after `EconomyManager` and `ProductionManager`, `MilitaryManager` runs its cached plan from last evaluation.

#### Evaluation and Threat Assessment

The evaluation function is the foundation of all AI decision-making. A bad evaluation function makes every other component worse (MicroRTS research). Iron Curtain uses **Lanchester-inspired threat scoring**:

```
threat(army) = Σ(unit_dps × unit_hp) × count^0.7
```

This captures Lanchester's Square Law — military power scales superlinearly with unit count. Two tanks aren't twice as effective as one; they're ~1.6× as effective (at exponent 0.7, conservative vs. full Lanchester exponent of 2.0). The exponent is a YAML-tunable personality parameter, allowing presets to value army mass differently.

For evaluating damage taken against our own units:

```
value(unit) = unit_cost × sqrt(hp / max_hp) × 40
```

The `sqrt(hp/maxHP)` gives diminishing returns for overkill — killing a 10% HP unit is worth less than the same cost in fresh units. This is the MicroRTS `SimpleSqrtEvaluationFunction` pattern, validated across years of AI competition.

Both formulas use fixed-point arithmetic (integer math only, consistent with sim determinism).

#### Phase 5+ Enhancements

These techniques are explicitly deferred — the Phase 4 AI ships without them:

- **Strategy classification and adaptation:** Track opponent behavior patterns (build timing, unit composition, attack frequency). Classify into archetypes: "rush", "turtle", "boom", "all-in". Select counter-strategy from personality parameters. This is the MicroRTS Stratified Strategy Selection (SCV) pattern applied at RTS scale.
- **Active scouting system:** No surveyed project scouts well — opportunity to lead. Periodically send cheap units to explore unknown areas. Maintain "last seen" timestamps for enemy building locations in `AiState::ScoutingMemory`. Higher urgency when opponent is quiet (they're probably teching up).
- **Multi-pronged attacks:** Graduate from Petra/OpenRA's single-army-blob pattern. Split forces based on attack plan (main force + flanking/harassment force). Coordinate timing via shared countdown in `AiState`. The `AiEventLog` (D041) enables coordination visibility between sub-plans.
- **Advanced micro:** Kiting, focus-fire priority targeting, ability usage. Kept out of Phase 4 to avoid the "chasing optimal AI" anti-pattern.

#### What to Explicitly Not Do

Five anti-patterns identified from surveyed implementations (full analysis in `research/rts-ai-implementation-survey.md` §9):

1. **Don't implement MCTS/minimax for strategic decisions.** The search space is too large for 500+ unit games. MicroRTS research confirms: portfolio/script search beats raw MCTS at RTS scale. Reserve tree search for micro-scale decisions only (if at all).
2. **Don't use behavior trees for the strategic AI.** Every surveyed RTS uses priority cascades or manager hierarchies, not BTs. BTs add complexity without proven benefit at RTS strategic scale.
3. **Don't chase "optimal" AI at launch.** RA shipped with terrible AI and sold 10 million copies. The Remastered Collection shipped with the same terrible AI. Get a good-enough AI working, then iterate. Phase 4 target: "better than EA RA, comparable to OpenRA."
4. **Don't hardcode strategies.** Use YAML configuration (the personality model above) so modders and the difficulty system can tune behavior without code changes.
5. **Don't skip evaluation function design.** A bad evaluation function makes every other AI component worse. Invest time in getting threat assessment right (Lanchester scoring above) — it's the foundation everything else builds on.

#### AI Performance Budget

Based on the efficiency pyramid (D015) and surveyed projects' performance characteristics (see also `10-PERFORMANCE.md`):

| AI Component                   | Frequency             | Target Time | Approach                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Harvester assignment           | Every 4 ticks         | < 0.1ms     | Nearest-resource lookup    |
| Defense response               | Every tick (reactive) | < 0.1ms     | Event-driven, not polling  |
| Unit production                | Every 8 ticks         | < 0.2ms     | Priority queue evaluation  |
| Building placement             | On demand             | < 1.0ms     | Influence map lookup       |
| Attack planning                | Every 30 ticks        | < 2.0ms     | Composition check + timing |
| Strategic reassessment         | Every 60 ticks        | < 5.0ms     | Full state evaluation      |
| **Total per tick (amortized)** |                       | **< 0.5ms** | **Budget for 500 units**   |

All AI working memory (influence maps, squad rosters, composition tallies, priority queues) is pre-allocated in `AiScratch` — analogous to `TickScratch` (Layer 5 of the efficiency pyramid). Zero per-tick heap allocation. Influence maps are fixed-size arrays, cleared and rebuilt on their evaluation schedule.

### Configuration Model

AI presets are YAML-driven, paralleling balance presets:

```yaml
# ai/presets/classic-ra.yaml
ai_preset:
  name: "Classic Red Alert"
  description: "Faithful recreation of original RA AI behavior"
  strategy: personality-driven     # AiStrategy implementation to use
  personality:
    aggression: 0.6
    tech_priority: rush
    micro_level: none              # no individual unit control
    scout_frequency: never
    build_order: scripted          # fixed build queues per faction
    expansion_style: base_walk     # builds structures adjacent to existing base
    focus_fire: false
    retreat_behavior: never        # units fight to the death
    adaptation: none               # doesn't change strategy based on opponent
    group_tactics: blob            # all units in one control group

# ai/presets/ic-default.yaml
ai_preset:
  name: "IC Default"
  description: "Research-informed AI with modern RTS intelligence"
  strategy: personality-driven
  personality:
    aggression: 0.5
    tech_priority: balanced
    micro_level: moderate          # focus-fire, kiting ranged units, retreat wounded
    scout_frequency: periodic      # sends scouts every 60-90 seconds
    build_order: adaptive          # adjusts build based on scouting information
    expansion_style: strategic     # expands to control resource nodes
    focus_fire: true
    retreat_behavior: wounded      # retreats units below 30% HP
    adaptation: reactive           # counters observed army composition
    group_tactics: multi_prong     # splits forces for flanking/harassment
    influence_maps: true           # uses influence maps for threat assessment
    harassment: true               # sends small squads to attack economy
```

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D019 (balance presets):** Orthogonal. Balance defines *what units can do*; AI presets define *how the AI uses them*. A player can combine any balance preset with any AI preset. "Classic RA balance + IC Default AI" is valid and interesting.
- **D041 (`AiStrategy` trait):** AI presets are configurations for the default `PersonalityDrivenAi` strategy. The trait allows entirely different AI algorithms (neural net, GOAP planner); presets are parameter sets within one algorithm. Both coexist — presets for built-in AI, traits for custom AI.
- **D042 (`StyleDrivenAi`):** Player behavioral profiles are a fourth source of AI behavior (alongside Classic/OpenRA/IC Default presets). No conflict — `StyleDrivenAi` implements `AiStrategy` independently of presets.
- **D033 (QoL toggles / experience profiles):** AI preset selection integrates naturally into experience profiles. The "Classic Red Alert" experience profile bundles classic balance + classic AI + classic theme.

### Experience Profile Integration

```yaml
profiles:
  classic-ra:
    balance: classic
    ai_preset: classic-ra          # D043 — original RA AI behavior
    pathfinding: classic-ra        # D045 — original RA movement feel
    render_mode: classic           # D048 — original sprite rendering
    theme: classic
    qol: vanilla

  openra-ra:
    balance: openra
    ai_preset: openra
    pathfinding: openra            # D045 — OpenRA movement feel
    render_mode: classic           # D048
    theme: modern
    qol: openra

  iron-curtain-ra:
    balance: classic
    ai_preset: ic-default          # D043 — enhanced AI
    pathfinding: ic-default        # D045 — modern flowfield movement
    render_mode: hd                # D048 — high-definition sprites
    theme: modern
    qol: iron_curtain
```

### Lobby Integration

AI preset is selectable per AI player slot in the lobby, independent of game-wide balance preset:

```
Player 1: [Human]           Faction: Soviet
Player 2: [AI] IC Default (Hard)    Faction: Allied
Player 3: [AI] Classic RA (Normal)  Faction: Allied
Player 4: [AI] OpenRA (Brutal)      Faction: Soviet

Balance Preset: Classic RA
```

This allows mixed AI playstyles in the same game – useful for testing, fun for variety, and educational for understanding how different AI approaches handle the same scenario.

### Community AI Presets

Modders can create custom AI presets as Workshop resources (D030):

- YAML preset files defining `personality` parameters for `PersonalityDrivenAi`
- Full `AiStrategy` implementations via WASM Tier 3 mods (D041)
- AI tournament brackets: community members compete by submitting AI presets, tournament server runs automated matches

### Engine-Level Difficulty System

Inspired by 0 A.D.'s two-axis difficulty (engine cheats + behavioral parameters) and AoE2's strategic number scaling with opt-out (see `research/rts-ai-extensibility-survey.md`), Iron Curtain separates difficulty into two independent layers:

**Layer 1 — Engine scaling (applies to ALL AI players by default):**

The engine provides resource, build-time, and reaction-time multipliers that scale an AI's raw capability independent of how smart its decisions are. This ensures that even a simple YAML-configured AI can be made harder or easier without touching its behavioral parameters.

```yaml
# difficulties/built-in.yaml
difficulties:
  sandbox:
    name: "Sandbox"
    description: "AI barely acts — for learning the interface"
    engine_scaling:
      resource_gather_rate: 0.5     # AI gathers half speed (fixed-point: 512/1024)
      build_time_multiplier: 1.5    # AI builds 50% slower
      reaction_delay_ticks: 30      # AI waits 30 ticks (~1s) before acting on events
      vision_range_multiplier: 0.8  # AI sees 20% less
    personality_overrides:
      aggression: 0.1
      adaptation: none

  easy:
    name: "Easy"
    engine_scaling:
      resource_gather_rate: 0.8
      build_time_multiplier: 1.2
      reaction_delay_ticks: 8
      vision_range_multiplier: 1.0

  normal:
    name: "Normal"
    engine_scaling:
      resource_gather_rate: 1.0     # No modification
      build_time_multiplier: 1.0
      reaction_delay_ticks: 0
      vision_range_multiplier: 1.0

  hard:
    name: "Hard"
    engine_scaling:
      resource_gather_rate: 1.0     # No economic bonus
      build_time_multiplier: 1.0
      reaction_delay_ticks: 0
      vision_range_multiplier: 1.0
    # Hard is purely behavioral — the AI makes smarter decisions, not cheaper ones
    personality_overrides:
      micro_level: moderate
      adaptation: reactive

  brutal:
    name: "Brutal"
    engine_scaling:
      resource_gather_rate: 1.3     # AI gets 30% bonus
      build_time_multiplier: 0.8    # AI builds 20% faster
      reaction_delay_ticks: 0
      vision_range_multiplier: 1.2  # AI sees 20% further
    personality_overrides:
      aggression: 0.8
      micro_level: extreme
      adaptation: full
```

**Layer 2 — Implementation-level difficulty (per-`AiStrategy` impl):**

Each `AiStrategy` implementation interprets difficulty through its own behavioral parameters. `PersonalityDrivenAi` uses the `personality:` YAML config (aggression, micro level, adaptation). A neural-net AI might have a "skill cap" parameter. A GOAP planner might limit search depth. The `get_parameters()` method (from MicroRTS research) exposes these as introspectable knobs.

**Engine scaling opt-out** (from AoE2's `sn-do-not-scale-for-difficulty-level`): Sophisticated AI implementations that model difficulty internally can opt out of engine scaling by returning `false` from `uses_engine_difficulty_scaling()`. This prevents double-scaling — an advanced AI that already weakens its play at Easy difficulty shouldn't also get the engine's gather-rate penalty on top.

**Modder-addable difficulty levels:** Difficulty levels are YAML files, not hardcoded enums. Community modders can define new difficulties via Workshop (D030) — no code required (Tier 1):

```yaml
# workshop: community/nightmare-difficulty/difficulty.yaml
difficulty:
  name: "Nightmare"
  description: "Economy bonuses + perfect micro — for masochists"
  engine_scaling:
    resource_gather_rate: 2.0
    build_time_multiplier: 0.5
    reaction_delay_ticks: 0
    vision_range_multiplier: 1.5
  personality_overrides:
    aggression: 0.95
    micro_level: extreme
    adaptation: full
    harassment: true
    group_tactics: multi_prong
```

Once installed, "Nightmare" appears alongside built-in difficulties in the lobby dropdown. Any `AiStrategy` implementation (first-party or community) can be paired with any difficulty level — they compose independently.

### Mod-Selectable and Mod-Provided AI

The three built-in behavior presets (Classic RA, OpenRA, IC Default) are configurations for `PersonalityDrivenAi`. They are not the only `AiStrategy` implementations. The trait (D041) is explicitly open to community implementations — following the same pattern as `Pathfinder` (D013/D045) and render modes (D048).

**Two-axis lobby selection:**

In the lobby, each AI player slot has two independent selections:

1. **AI implementation** — which `AiStrategy` algorithm
2. **Difficulty level** — which engine scaling + personality config

```
Player 2: [AI] IC Default / Hard        Faction: Allied
Player 3: [AI] Classic RA / Normal      Faction: Allied
Player 4: [AI] Workshop: GOAP Planner / Brutal   Faction: Soviet
Player 5: [AI] Workshop: Neural Net v2 / Nightmare   Faction: Soviet

Balance Preset: Classic RA
```

This is different from pathfinders (one axis: which algorithm). AI has two orthogonal axes because *how smart the AI plays* and *what advantages it gets* are independent concerns. A "Brutal Classic RA" AI should play with original 1996 patterns but get economic bonuses and instant reactions; an "Easy IC Default" AI should use modern tactics but gather slowly and react late.

**Modder as consumer — selecting an AI:**

A mod's YAML manifest can declare which `AiStrategy` implementations it ships with or requires:

```yaml
# mod.yaml — total conversion with custom AI
mod:
  name: "Zero Hour Remake"
  ai_strategies:
    - goap-planner              # Requires this community AI
    - personality-driven        # Also supports the built-in default
  default_ai: goap-planner
  depends:
    - community/goap-planner-ai@^2.0
```

If the mod doesn't specify `ai_strategies`, all registered AI implementations are available.

**Modder as author — providing an AI:**

A Tier 3 WASM mod can implement the `AiStrategy` trait and register it:

```rust
// WASM mod: GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) AI
impl AiStrategy for GoapPlannerAi {
    fn decide(&mut self, player: PlayerId, view: &FogFilteredView, tick: u64) -> Vec<PlayerOrder> {
        // 1. Update world model from FogFilteredView
        // 2. Evaluate goal priorities (expand? attack? defend? tech?)
        // 3. GOAP search: find action sequence to achieve highest-priority goal
        // 4. Emit orders for first action in plan
        // ...
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &str { "GOAP Planner" }
    fn difficulty(&self) -> AiDifficulty { AiDifficulty::Custom("adaptive".into()) }

    fn on_enemy_spotted(&mut self, unit: EntityId, unit_type: &str) {
        // Re-prioritize goals: if enemy spotted near base, defend goal priority increases
        self.goal_priorities.defend += self.threat_weight(unit_type);
    }

    fn on_under_attack(&mut self, _unit: EntityId, _attacker: EntityId) {
        // Emergency re-plan: abort current plan, switch to defense
        self.force_replan = true;
    }

    fn get_parameters(&self) -> Vec<ParameterSpec> {
        vec![
            ParameterSpec { name: "plan_depth".into(), min_value: 1, max_value: 10, default_value: 5, .. },
            ParameterSpec { name: "replan_interval".into(), min_value: 10, max_value: 120, default_value: 30, .. },
            ParameterSpec { name: "aggression_weight".into(), min_value: 0, max_value: 100, default_value: 50, .. },
        ]
    }

    fn uses_engine_difficulty_scaling(&self) -> bool { false } // handles difficulty internally
}
```

The mod registers its AI in its manifest:

```yaml
# goap_planner/mod.yaml
mod:
  name: "GOAP Planner AI"
  type: ai_strategy
  ai_strategy_id: goap-planner
  display_name: "GOAP Planner"
  description: "Goal-oriented action planning AI — plans multi-step strategies"
  wasm_module: goap_planner.wasm
  capabilities:
    read_visible_state: true
    issue_orders: true
  config:
    plan_depth: 5
    replan_interval_ticks: 30
```

**Workshop distribution:** Community AI implementations are Workshop resources (D030). They can be rated, reviewed, and depended upon — same as pathfinder mods. The Workshop can host AI tournament leaderboards: automated matches between community AI submissions, ranked by Elo/TrueSkill (inspired by BWAPI's SSCAIT and AoE2's AI ladder communities, see `research/rts-ai-extensibility-survey.md`).

**Multiplayer implications:** AI selection is NOT sim-affecting in the same way pathfinding is. In a human-vs-AI game, each AI player can run a different `AiStrategy` — they're independent agents. In AI-vs-AI tournaments, all AI players can be different. The engine doesn't need to validate that all clients have the same AI WASM module (unlike pathfinding). However, for determinism, the AI's `decide()` output must be identical on all clients — so the WASM binary hash IS validated per AI player slot.

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D019 (balance presets):** Orthogonal. Balance defines *what units can do*; AI presets define *how the AI uses them*. A player can combine any balance preset with any AI preset. "Classic RA balance + IC Default AI" is valid and interesting.
- **D041 (`AiStrategy` trait):** AI behavior presets are configurations for the default `PersonalityDrivenAi` strategy. The trait allows entirely different AI algorithms (neural net, GOAP planner); presets are parameter sets within one algorithm. Both coexist — presets for built-in AI, traits for custom AI. The trait now includes event callbacks, parameter introspection, and engine scaling opt-out based on cross-project research.
- **D042 (`StyleDrivenAi`):** Player behavioral profiles are a fourth source of AI behavior (alongside Classic/OpenRA/IC Default presets). No conflict — `StyleDrivenAi` implements `AiStrategy` independently of presets.
- **D033 (QoL toggles / experience profiles):** AI preset selection integrates naturally into experience profiles. The "Classic Red Alert" experience profile bundles classic balance + classic AI + classic theme.
- **D045 (pathfinding presets):** Same modder-selectable pattern. Mods select or provide pathfinders; mods select or provide AI implementations. Both distribute via Workshop; both compose with experience profiles. Key difference: pathfinding is one axis (algorithm), AI is two axes (algorithm + difficulty).
- **D048 (render modes):** Same modder-selectable pattern. The trait-per-subsystem architecture means every pluggable system follows the same model: engine ships built-in implementations, mods can add more, players/modders pick what they want.

### Alternatives Considered

- AI difficulty only, no style presets (rejected — difficulty is orthogonal to style; a "Hard Classic RA" AI should be hard but still play like original RA, not like a modern AI turned up)
- One "best" AI only (rejected — the community is split like they are on balance; offer choice)
- Lua-only AI scripting (rejected — too slow for tick-level decisions; Lua is for mission triggers, WASM for full AI replacement)
- Difficulty as a fixed enum only (rejected — modders should be able to define new difficulty levels via YAML without code changes; AoE2's 20+ years of community AI prove that a large parameter space outlasts a restrictive one)
- No engine-level difficulty scaling (rejected — delegating difficulty entirely to AI implementations produces inconsistent experiences across different AIs; 0 A.D. and AoE2 both provide engine scaling with opt-out, proving this is the right separation of concerns)
- No event callbacks on `AiStrategy` (rejected — polling-only AI misses reactive opportunities; Spring Engine and BWAPI both use event + tick hybrid, which is the proven model)

## D044: LLM-Enhanced AI — Orchestrator and Experimental LLM Player

**Status:** Accepted
**Scope:** `ic-llm`, `ic-ai`, `ic-sim` (read-only)
**Phase:** LLM Orchestrator: Phase 7. LLM Player: Experimental, no scheduled phase.

### The Problem

D016 provides LLM integration for mission generation. D042 provides LLM coaching between games. But neither addresses LLM involvement *during* gameplay — using an LLM to influence or directly control AI decisions in real-time. Two distinct use cases exist:

1. **Enhancing existing AI** — an LLM advisor that reads game state and nudges a conventional AI toward better strategic decisions, without replacing the tick-level execution
2. **Full LLM control** — an experimental mode where an LLM makes every decision, exploring whether modern language models can play RTS games competently

### Decision

Define two new `AiStrategy` implementations (D041) for LLM-integrated gameplay:

### 1. LLM Orchestrator (`LlmOrchestratorAi`)

Wraps any existing `AiStrategy` implementation (D041) and periodically consults an LLM for high-level strategic guidance. The inner AI handles tick-level execution; the LLM provides strategic direction.

```rust
/// Wraps an existing AiStrategy with LLM strategic oversight.
/// The inner AI makes tick-level decisions; the LLM provides
/// periodic strategic guidance that the inner AI incorporates.
pub struct LlmOrchestratorAi {
    inner: Box<dyn AiStrategy>,         // the AI that actually issues orders
    provider: Box<dyn LlmProvider>,     // D016 BYOLLM
    consultation_interval: u64,         // ticks between LLM consultations
    last_consultation: u64,
    current_plan: Option<StrategicPlan>,
    event_log: AiEventLog,              // D041 — fog-filtered event accumulator
}
```

**How it works:**

```
Every N ticks (configurable, default ~300 = ~10 seconds at 30 tick/s):
  1. Serialize visible game state into a structured prompt:
     - Own base layout, army composition, resource levels
     - Known enemy positions, army composition estimate
     - Current strategic plan (if any)
     - event_log.to_narrative(last_consultation) — fog-filtered event chronicle
  2. Send prompt to LlmProvider (D016)
  3. LLM returns a StrategicPlan:
     - Priority targets (e.g., "attack enemy expansion at north")
     - Build focus (e.g., "switch to anti-air production")
     - Economic guidance (e.g., "expand to second ore field")
     - Risk assessment (e.g., "enemy likely to push soon, fortify choke")
  4. Translate StrategicPlan into inner AI parameter adjustments via set_parameter()
     (e.g., "switch to anti-air" → set_parameter("tech_priority_aa", 80))
  5. Record plan change as StrategicUpdate event in event_log
  6. Inner AI incorporates guidance into its normal tick-level decisions

Between consultations:
  - Inner AI runs normally, using the last parameter adjustments as guidance
  - Tick-level micro, build queue management, unit control all handled by inner AI
  - No LLM latency in the hot path
  - Events continue accumulating in event_log for the next consultation
```

**Event log as LLM context (D041 integration):**

The `AiEventLog` (defined in D041) is the bridge between simulation events and LLM understanding. The orchestrator accumulates fog-filtered events from the D041 callback pipeline — `on_enemy_spotted`, `on_under_attack`, `on_unit_destroyed`, etc. — and serializes them into a natural-language narrative via `to_narrative(since_tick)`. This narrative is the "inner game event log / action story / context" the LLM reads to understand what happened since its last consultation.

The event log is **fog-filtered by construction** — all events originate from the same fog-filtered callback pipeline that respects `FogFilteredView`. The LLM never receives information about actions behind fog of war, only events the AI player is supposed to be aware of. This is an architectural guarantee, not a filtering step that could be bypassed.

**Event callback forwarding:**

The orchestrator implements all D041 event callbacks by forwarding to both the inner AI and the event log:

```rust
impl AiStrategy for LlmOrchestratorAi {
    fn decide(&mut self, player: PlayerId, view: &FogFilteredView, tick: u64) -> Vec<PlayerOrder> {
        // Check if it's time for an LLM consultation
        if tick - self.last_consultation >= self.consultation_interval {
            self.consult_llm(player, view, tick);
        }
        // Delegate tick-level decisions to the inner AI
        self.inner.decide(player, view, tick)
    }

    fn on_enemy_spotted(&mut self, unit: EntityId, unit_type: &str) {
        self.event_log.push(AiEventEntry {
            tick: self.current_tick,
            event_type: AiEventType::EnemySpotted,
            description: format!("Enemy {} spotted", unit_type),
            entity: Some(unit),
            related_entity: None,
        });
        self.inner.on_enemy_spotted(unit, unit_type);  // forward to inner AI
    }

    fn on_under_attack(&mut self, unit: EntityId, attacker: EntityId) {
        self.event_log.push(/* ... */);
        self.inner.on_under_attack(unit, attacker);
    }

    // ... all other callbacks follow the same pattern:
    // 1. Record in event_log  2. Forward to inner AI

    fn name(&self) -> &str { "LLM Orchestrator" }
    fn difficulty(&self) -> AiDifficulty { self.inner.difficulty() }
    fn tick_budget_hint(&self) -> Option<u64> { self.inner.tick_budget_hint() }

    // Delegate parameter introspection — expose orchestrator params + inner AI params
    fn get_parameters(&self) -> Vec<ParameterSpec> {
        let mut params = vec![
            ParameterSpec {
                name: "consultation_interval".into(),
                description: "Ticks between LLM consultations".into(),
                min_value: 30, max_value: 3000,
                default_value: 300, current_value: self.consultation_interval as i32,
            },
        ];
        // Include inner AI's parameters (prefixed for clarity)
        params.extend(self.inner.get_parameters());
        params
    }

    fn set_parameter(&mut self, name: &str, value: i32) {
        match name {
            "consultation_interval" => self.consultation_interval = value as u64,
            _ => self.inner.set_parameter(name, value),  // delegate to inner AI
        }
    }

    // Delegate engine scaling to inner AI — the orchestrator adds LLM guidance,
    // difficulty scaling applies to the underlying AI that executes orders
    fn uses_engine_difficulty_scaling(&self) -> bool {
        self.inner.uses_engine_difficulty_scaling()
    }
}
```

**How StrategicPlan reaches the inner AI:**

The orchestrator translates `StrategicPlan` fields into `set_parameter()` calls on the inner AI (D041). For example:
- "Switch to anti-air production" → `set_parameter("tech_priority_aa", 80)`
- "Be more aggressive" → `set_parameter("aggression", 75)`
- "Expand to second ore field" → `set_parameter("expansion_priority", 90)`

This uses D041's existing parameter introspection infrastructure — no new trait methods needed. The inner AI's `get_parameters()` exposes its tunable knobs; the LLM's strategic output maps to those knobs. An inner AI that doesn't expose relevant parameters simply ignores guidance it can't act on — the orchestrator degrades gracefully.

**Key design points:**
- **No latency impact on gameplay.** LLM consultation is async — fires off a request, continues with the previous plan until the response arrives. If the LLM is slow (or unavailable), the inner AI plays normally.
- **BYOLLM (D016).** Same provider system — users configure their own model. Local models (Ollama) give lowest latency; cloud APIs work but add ~1-3s round-trip per consultation.
- **Determinism maintained.** In multiplayer, the LLM runs on exactly one machine (the AI slot owner's client). The resulting `StrategicPlan` is submitted as an order through the `NetworkModel` — the same path as human player orders. Other clients never run the LLM; they receive and apply the same plan at the same deterministic tick boundary. In singleplayer, determinism is trivially preserved (orders are recorded in the replay, not LLM calls).
- **Inner AI is any `AiStrategy`.** Orchestrator wraps IC Default, Classic RA, a community WASM AI (D043), or even a `StyleDrivenAi` (D042). The LLM adds strategic thinking on top of whatever execution style is underneath. Because the orchestrator communicates through the generic `AiStrategy` trait (event callbacks + `set_parameter()`), it works with any implementation — including community-provided WASM AI mods.
- **Two-axis difficulty compatibility (D043).** The orchestrator delegates `difficulty()` and `uses_engine_difficulty_scaling()` to the inner AI. Engine-level difficulty scaling (resource bonuses, reaction delays) applies to the inner AI's execution; the LLM consultation frequency and depth are separate parameters exposed via `get_parameters()`. In the lobby, players select the inner AI + difficulty normally, then optionally enable LLM orchestration on top.
- **Observable.** The current `StrategicPlan` and the event log narrative are displayed in a debug overlay (developer/spectator mode), letting players see the LLM's "thinking" and the events that informed it.
- **Prompt engineering is in YAML.** Prompt templates are mod-data, not hardcoded. Modders can customize LLM prompts for different game modules or scenarios.

```yaml
# llm/prompts/orchestrator.yaml
orchestrator:
  system_prompt: |
    You are a strategic advisor for a Red Alert AI player.
    Analyze the game state and provide high-level strategic guidance.
    Do NOT issue specific unit orders — your AI subordinate handles execution.
    Focus on: what to build, where to expand, when to attack, what threats to prepare for.
  response_format:
    type: structured
    schema: StrategicPlan
  consultation_interval_ticks: 300
  max_tokens: 500
```

### 2. LLM Player (`LlmPlayerAi`) — Experimental

A fully LLM-driven player where the language model makes every decision. No inner AI — the LLM receives game state and emits player orders directly. This is the "LLM makes every small decision" path — the architecture supports it through the same `AiStrategy` trait and `AiEventLog` infrastructure as the orchestrator.

```rust
/// Experimental: LLM makes all decisions directly.
/// Every N ticks, the LLM receives game state and returns orders.
/// Performance and quality depend entirely on the LLM model and latency.
pub struct LlmPlayerAi {
    provider: Box<dyn LlmProvider>,
    decision_interval: u64,           // ticks between LLM decisions
    pending_orders: Vec<PlayerOrder>, // buffered orders from last LLM response
    order_cursor: usize,              // index into pending_orders for drip-feeding
    event_log: AiEventLog,            // D041 — fog-filtered event accumulator
}
```

**How it works:**
- Every N ticks, serialize `FogFilteredView` + `event_log.to_narrative(last_decision_tick)` → send to LLM → receive a batch of `PlayerOrder` values
- The event log narrative gives the LLM a chronological understanding of what happened — "what has been going on in this game" — rather than just a snapshot of current state
- Between decisions, drip-feed buffered orders to the sim (one or few per tick)
- If the LLM response is slow, the player idles (no orders until response arrives)
- Event callbacks continue accumulating into the event log between LLM decisions, building a richer narrative for the next consultation

**Why the event log matters for full LLM control:**

The LLM Player receives `FogFilteredView` (current game state) AND `AiEventLog` (recent game history). Together these give the LLM:
- **Spatial awareness** — what's where right now (from `FogFilteredView`)
- **Temporal awareness** — what happened recently (from the event log narrative)
- **Causal understanding** — "I was attacked from the north, my refinery was destroyed, I spotted 3 enemy tanks" forms a coherent story the LLM can reason about

Without the event log, the LLM would see only a static snapshot every N ticks, with no continuity between decisions. The log bridges decisions into a narrative that LLMs are natively good at processing.

**Why this is experimental:**
- **Latency.** Even local LLMs take 100-500ms per response. A 30 tick/s sim expects decisions every 33ms. The LLM Player will always be slower than a conventional AI.
- **Quality ceiling.** Current LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and precise micro. The LLM Player will likely lose to even Easy conventional AI in direct combat efficiency.
- **Cost.** Cloud LLMs charge per token. A full game might generate thousands of consultations. Local models are free but slower.
- **The value is educational and entertaining**, not competitive. Watching an LLM try to play Red Alert — making mistakes, forming unexpected strategies, explaining its reasoning — is intrinsically interesting. Community streaming of "GPT vs. Claude playing Red Alert" is a content opportunity.

**Design constraints:**
- **Never the default.** LLM Player is clearly labeled "Experimental" in the lobby.
- **Not allowed in ranked.** LLM AI modes are excluded from competitive matchmaking.
- **Observable.** The LLM's reasoning text and event log narrative are capturable as a spectator overlay, enabling commentary-style viewing.
- **Same BYOLLM infrastructure.** Uses `LlmProvider` trait (D016), same configuration, same provider options.
- **Two-axis difficulty compatibility (D043).** Engine-level difficulty scaling (resource bonuses, reaction delays) applies normally — `uses_engine_difficulty_scaling()` returns `true`. The LLM's "skill" is inherent in the model's capability and prompt engineering, not in engine parameters. `get_parameters()` exposes LLM-specific knobs: decision interval, max tokens, model selection, prompt template — but the LLM's quality is ultimately model-dependent, not engine-controlled. This is an honest design: we don't pretend to make the LLM "harder" or "easier" through engine scaling, but we do let the engine give it economic advantages or handicaps.
- **Determinism:** The LLM runs on one machine (the AI slot owner's client) and submits orders through the `NetworkModel`, just like human input. All clients apply the same orders at the same deterministic tick boundaries. The LLM itself is non-deterministic (different responses per run), but that non-determinism is resolved before orders enter the sim — the sim only sees deterministic order streams. Replays record orders (not LLM calls), so replay playback is fully deterministic.

### Relationship to D041/D043 — Integration Summary

The LLM AI modes build entirely on the `AiStrategy` trait (D041) and the two-axis difficulty system (D043):

| Concern                             | Orchestrator                                                                                   | LLM Player                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implements `AiStrategy`?            | Yes — wraps an inner `AiStrategy`                                                              | Yes — direct implementation                                 |

| Event callbacks?                    | Forwards to inner AI + records in event log                                                    | Records in event log for next LLM consultation              |
| `set_parameter()`?                  | Exposes orchestrator params + delegates to inner AI; translates LLM plans to param adjustments | Exposes LLM-specific params (decision_interval, max_tokens) |
| `get_parameters()`?                 | Returns orchestrator params + inner AI's params                                                | Returns LLM Player params                                   |
| `uses_engine_difficulty_scaling()`? | Delegates to inner AI                                                                          | Returns `true` (engine bonuses/handicaps apply)             |
| `difficulty()`?                     | Delegates to inner AI                                                                          | Returns selected difficulty (user picks in lobby)           |
| Two-axis difficulty?                | Inner AI axis applies to execution; orchestrator params are separate                           | Engine scaling applies; LLM quality is model-dependent      |

The critical architectural property: **neither LLM AI mode introduces any new trait methods, crate dependencies, or sim-layer concepts.** They compose entirely from existing infrastructure — `AiStrategy`, `AiEventLog`, `FogFilteredView`, `set_parameter()`, `LlmProvider`. This means the LLM AI path doesn't constrain or complicate the non-LLM AI path. A modder who never uses LLM features is completely unaffected.

### Future Path: Full LLM Control at Scale

The current `LlmPlayerAi` is limited by latency (LLM responses take 100-500ms vs. 33ms sim ticks) and spatial reasoning capability. As LLM inference speeds improve and models gain better spatial/numerical reasoning, the same architecture scales:
- Faster models → lower `decision_interval` → more responsive LLM play
- Better spatial reasoning → LLM can handle micro, not just strategy
- Multimodal models → render a minimap image as additional LLM context alongside the event narrative
- The `AiStrategy` trait, `AiEventLog`, and `FogFilteredView` infrastructure are all model-agnostic — they serve whatever LLM capability exists at runtime

The architecture is deliberately designed not to stand in the way of full LLM control becoming practical. Every piece needed for "LLM makes every small decision" already exists in the trait design — the only bottleneck is LLM speed and quality, which are external constraints that improve over time.

### Crate Boundaries

| Component                     | Crate    | Reason                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LlmOrchestratorAi` struct    | `ic-ai`  | AI strategy implementation                                     |
| `LlmPlayerAi` struct          | `ic-ai`  | AI strategy implementation                                     |
| `StrategicPlan` type          | `ic-ai`  | AI-internal data structure                                     |
| `AiEventLog` struct           | `ic-ai`  | Engine-provided event accumulator (D041 design, `ic-ai` impl)  |
| `LlmProvider` trait           | `ic-llm` | Existing D016 infrastructure                                   |
| Prompt templates (YAML)       | mod data | Game-module-specific, moddable                                 |
| Game state serializer for LLM | `ic-ai`  | Reads sim state (read-only), formats for LLM prompts           |
| Debug overlay (plan viewer)   | `ic-ui`  | Spectator/dev UI for observing LLM reasoning + event narrative |

### Alternatives Considered

- LLM replaces inner AI entirely in orchestrator mode (rejected — latency makes tick-level LLM control impractical; hybrid is better)
- LLM operates between games only (rejected — D042 already covers between-game coaching; real-time guidance is the new capability)
- No LLM Player mode (rejected — the experimental mode has minimal implementation cost and high community interest/entertainment value)
- LLM in the sim crate (rejected — violates BYOLLM optionality; `ic-ai` imports `ic-llm` optionally, `ic-sim` never imports either)
- New trait method `set_strategic_guidance()` for LLM → inner AI communication (rejected — `set_parameter()` already provides the mechanism; adding an LLM-specific method to the generic `AiStrategy` trait would couple the trait to an optional feature)
- Custom event log per AI instead of engine-provided `AiEventLog` (rejected — the log benefits all AI implementations for debugging/observation, not just LLM; making it engine infrastructure avoids redundant implementations)

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D016 (BYOLLM):** Same provider infrastructure. Both LLM AI modes use `LlmProvider` trait for model access.
- **D041 (`AiStrategy` trait):** Both modes implement `AiStrategy`. The orchestrator wraps any `AiStrategy` via the generic trait. Both use `AiEventLog` (D041) for fog-filtered event accumulation. The orchestrator communicates with the inner AI through `set_parameter()` and event callback forwarding — all D041 infrastructure.
- **D042 (`StyleDrivenAi`):** The orchestrator can wrap `StyleDrivenAi` — LLM strategic guidance on top of a mimicked player's style. The `AiEventLog` serves both D042 (profile building reads events) and D044 (LLM reads events).
- **D043 (AI presets + two-axis difficulty):** LLM AI integrates with the two-axis difficulty system. Orchestrator delegates difficulty to inner AI; LLM Player accepts engine scaling. Users select inner AI + difficulty in the lobby, then optionally enable LLM orchestration.
- **D031 (telemetry):** The `GameplayEvent` stream (D031) feeds the fog-filtered callback pipeline that populates `AiEventLog`. D031 is the raw data source; D041 callbacks are the filtered AI-facing interface; `AiEventLog` is the accumulated narrative.
- **D034 (SQLite):** LLM consultation history (prompts sent, plans received, execution outcomes) stored in SQLite for debugging and quality analysis. No new tables required — uses the existing `gameplay_events` schema with LLM-specific event types.
- **D057 (Skill Library):** The orchestrator is the primary producer and consumer of AI strategy skills. Proven `StrategicPlan` outputs are stored in the skill library; future consultations retrieve relevant skills as few-shot prompt context. See D057 for the full verification→storage→retrieval loop.

## D045: Pathfinding Behavior Presets — Movement Feel

**Status:** Accepted
**Scope:** `ic-sim`, game module configuration
**Phase:** Phase 2 (ships with simulation)

### The Problem

D013 provides the `Pathfinder` trait for pluggable pathfinding *algorithms* (multi-layer hybrid vs. navmesh). D019 provides switchable *balance* values. But movement *feel* — how units navigate, group, avoid each other, and handle congestion — varies dramatically between Classic RA, OpenRA, and what modern pathfinding research enables. This is partially balance (unit speed values) but mostly *behavioral*: how the pathfinder handles collisions, how units merge into formations, how traffic jams resolve, and how responsive movement commands feel.

### Decision

Ship **pathfinding behavior presets** as separate `Pathfinder` trait implementations (D013), each sourced from the codebase it claims to reproduce. Presets are selectable alongside balance presets (D019) and AI presets (D043), bundled into experience profiles, and presented through progressive disclosure so casual players never see the word "pathfinding."

### Built-In Presets

| Preset         | Movement Feel                                                                                                                                                                 | Source                                             | `Pathfinder` Implementation |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Classic RA** | Unit-level A*-like pathing, units block each other, congestion causes jams, no formation movement, units take wide detours around obstacles                                   | EA Remastered Collection source code (GPL v3)      | `RemastersPathfinder`       |
| **OpenRA**     | Improved cell-based pathing, basic crush/push logic, units attempt to flow around blockages, locomotor-based speed modifiers, no formal formations                            | OpenRA pathfinding implementation (GPL v3)         | `OpenRaPathfinder`          |
| **IC Default** | Multi-layer hybrid: hierarchical sectors for routing, JPS for small groups, flow field tiles for mass movement, ORCA-lite local avoidance, formation-aware group coordination | Open-source RTS research + IC original (see below) | `IcPathfinder`              |

Each preset is a **distinct `Pathfinder` trait implementation**, not a parameterized variant of one algorithm. The Remastered pathfinder and OpenRA pathfinder use fundamentally different algorithms and produce fundamentally different movement behavior — parameterizing one to emulate the other would be an approximation at best and a lie at worst. The `Pathfinder` trait (D013) was designed for exactly this: slot in different implementations without touching sim code.

**Why "IcPathfinder," not "IcFlowfieldPathfinder"?** Research revealed that no shipped RTS engine uses pure flowfields (except SupCom2/PA by the same team). Spring Engine tried flow maps and abandoned them. Independent developers (jdxdev) documented the same "ant line" failure with 100+ units. IC's default pathfinder is a multi-layer hybrid — flowfield tiles are one layer activated for large groups, not the system's identity. See `research/pathfinding-ic-default-design.md` for full architecture.

**Why Remastered, not original RA source?** The Remastered Collection engine DLLs (GPL v3) contain the same pathfinding logic as original RA but with bug fixes and modernized C++ that's easier to port to Rust. The original RA source is also GPL and available for cross-reference. Both produce the same movement feel — the Remastered version is simply a cleaner starting point.

### IC Default Pathfinding — Research Foundation

The IC Default preset (`IcPathfinder`) is a five-layer hybrid architecture synthesizing pathfinding approaches from across the open-source RTS ecosystem and academic research. Full design: `research/pathfinding-ic-default-design.md`.

**Layer 1 — Cost Field & Passability:** Per-cell movement cost (u8, 1–255) per locomotor type, inspired by EA Remastered terrain cost tables and 0 A.D.'s passability classes.

**Layer 2 — Hierarchical Sector Graph:** Map divided into 32×32-cell sectors with portal connections between them. Flood-fill domain IDs for O(1) reachability checks. Inspired by OpenRA's hierarchical abstraction and HPA* research.

**Layer 3 — Adaptive Detailed Pathfinding:** JPS (Jump Point Search) for small groups (<8 units) — 10–100× faster than A* on uniform-cost grids. Flow field tiles for mass movement (≥8 units sharing a destination). Weighted A* fallback for non-uniform terrain. LRU flow field cache. Inspired by 0 A.D.'s JPS, SupCom2's flow field tiles, Game AI Pro 2's JPS+ precomputed tables.

**Layer 4 — ORCA-lite Local Avoidance:** Fixed-point deterministic collision avoidance based on RVO2/ORCA (Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles). Commitment locking prevents hallway dance. Cooperative side selection ("mind reading") from HowToRTS research.

**Layer 5 — Group Coordination:** Formation offset assignment, synchronized arrival, chokepoint compression. Inspired by jdxdev's boids-for-RTS formation offsets and Spring Engine's group movement.

**Source engines studied:**
- **EA Remastered Collection** (GPL v3) — obstacle-tracing, terrain cost tables, integer math
- **OpenRA** (GPL v3) — hierarchical A*, custom search graph with 10×10 abstraction
- **Spring Engine** (GPL v2) — QTPFS quadtree, flow-map attempt (abandoned), unit push/slide
- **0 A.D.** (GPL v2/MIT) — JPS long-range + vertex short-range, clearance-based sizing, fixed-point `CFixed_15_16`
- **Warzone 2100** (GPL v2) — A* with LRU context caching, gateway optimization
- **SupCom2/PA** — flow field tiles (only shipped flowfield RTS)
- **Academic** — RVO2/ORCA (UNC), HPA*, continuum crowds (Treuille et al.), JPS+ (Game AI Pro 2)

### Configuration Model

Each `Pathfinder` implementation exposes its own tunable parameters via YAML. Parameters differ between implementations because they control fundamentally different algorithms — there is no shared "pathfinding config" struct that applies to all three.

```yaml
# pathfinding/remastered.yaml — RemastersPathfinder tunables
remastered_pathfinder:
  name: "Classic Red Alert"
  description: "Movement feel matching the original game"
  # These are behavioral overrides on the Remastered pathfinder.
  # Defaults reproduce original behavior exactly.
  harvester_stuck_fix: false         # true = apply minor QoL fix for harvesters stuck on each other
  bridge_queue_behavior: original    # original | relaxed (slightly wider queue threshold)
  infantry_scatter_pattern: original # original | smoothed (less jagged scatter on damage)

# pathfinding/openra.yaml — OpenRaPathfinder tunables
openra_pathfinder:
  name: "OpenRA"
  description: "Movement feel matching OpenRA's pathfinding"
  locomotor_speed_modifiers: true    # per-terrain speed multipliers (OpenRA feature)
  crush_logic: true                  # vehicles can crush infantry
  blockage_flow: true                # units attempt to flow around blocking units

# pathfinding/ic-default.yaml — IcPathfinder tunables
ic_pathfinder:
  name: "IC Default"
  description: "Multi-layer hybrid: JPS + flow field tiles + ORCA-lite avoidance"

  # Layer 2 — Hierarchical sectors
  sector_size: 32                    # cells per sector side
  portal_max_width: 8                # max portal opening (cells)

  # Layer 3 — Adaptive pathfinding
  flowfield_group_threshold: 8       # units sharing dest before flowfield activates
  flowfield_cache_size: 64           # LRU cache entries for flow field tiles
  jps_enabled: true                  # JPS for small groups on uniform terrain
  repath_frequency: adaptive         # low | medium | high | adaptive

  # Layer 4 — Local avoidance (ORCA-lite)
  avoidance_radius_multiplier: 1.2   # multiplier on unit collision radius
  commitment_frames: 4               # frames locked into avoidance direction
  cooperative_avoidance: true        # "mind reading" side selection

  # Layer 5 — Group coordination
  formation_movement: true           # groups move in formation
  synchronized_arrival: true         # units slow down to arrive together
  chokepoint_compression: true       # formation compresses at narrow passages

  # General
  path_smoothing: funnel             # none | funnel | spline
  influence_avoidance: true          # avoid areas with high enemy threat
```

Power users can override any parameter in the lobby's advanced settings or in mod YAML. Casual players never see these — they pick an experience profile and the correct implementation + parameters are selected automatically.

### Sim-Affecting Nature

Pathfinding presets are **sim-affecting** — they change how the deterministic simulation resolves movement. Like balance presets (D019):

- All players in a multiplayer game must use the same pathfinding preset (enforced by lobby, validated by sim)
- Preset selection is part of the game configuration hash for desync detection
- Replays record the active pathfinding preset

### Experience Profile Integration

```yaml
profiles:
  classic-ra:
    balance: classic
    ai_preset: classic-ra
    pathfinding: classic-ra          # NEW — movement feel
    theme: classic
    qol: vanilla

  openra-ra:
    balance: openra
    ai_preset: openra
    pathfinding: openra              # NEW — OpenRA movement feel
    theme: modern
    qol: openra

  iron-curtain-ra:
    balance: classic
    ai_preset: ic-default
    pathfinding: ic-default          # NEW — modern movement
    theme: modern
    qol: iron_curtain
```

### User-Facing UX — Progressive Disclosure

Pathfinding selection follows the same progressive disclosure pyramid as the rest of the experience profile system. A casual player should never encounter the word "pathfinding."

**Level 1 — One dropdown (casual player):** The lobby's experience profile selector offers "Classic RA," "OpenRA," or "Iron Curtain." Picking one sets balance, theme, QoL, AI, movement feel, AND render mode. The pathfinder and render mode selections are invisible — they're bundled. A player who picks "Classic RA" gets Remastered pathfinding and classic pixel art because that's what Classic RA *is*.

**Level 2 — Per-axis override (intermediate player):** An "Advanced" toggle in the lobby expands the experience profile into its 6 independent axes. The movement axis is labeled by feel, not algorithm: "Movement: Classic / OpenRA / Modern" — not "`RemastersPathfinder` / `OpenRaPathfinder` / `IcPathfinder`." The render mode axis shows "Graphics: Classic / HD / 3D" (D048). The player can mix "OpenRA balance + Classic movement + HD graphics" if they want.

**Level 3 — Parameter tuning (power user / modder):** A gear icon next to the movement axis opens implementation-specific parameters (see Configuration Model above). This is where harvester stuck fixes, pressure diffusion strength, and formation toggles live.

### Scenario-Required Pathfinding

Scenarios and campaign missions can specify a **required** or **recommended** pathfinding preset in their YAML metadata:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Bridge Assault"
  pathfinding:
    required: classic-ra    # this mission depends on chokepoint blocking behavior
    reason: "Mission balance depends on single-file bridge queuing"
```

When the lobby loads this scenario, it auto-selects the required pathfinder and shows the player why: "This scenario requires Classic movement (mission balance depends on chokepoint behavior)." The player cannot override a `required` setting. A `recommended` setting auto-selects but allows override with a warning.

This preserves original campaign missions. A mission designed around units jamming at a bridge works correctly because it ships with `required: classic-ra`. A modern community scenario can ship with `required: ic-default` to ensure smooth flowfield behavior.

### Mod-Selectable and Mod-Provided Pathfinders

The three built-in presets are the **first-party** `Pathfinder` implementations. They are not the only ones. The `Pathfinder` trait (D013) is explicitly open to community implementations.

**Modder as consumer — selecting a pathfinder:**

A mod's YAML manifest can declare which pathfinder it uses. The modder picks from any available implementation — first-party or community:

```yaml
# mod.yaml — total conversion mod that uses IC's modern pathfinding
mod:
  name: "Desert Strike"
  pathfinder: ic-default            # Use IC's multi-layer hybrid
  # Or: remastered, openra, layered-grid-generals, community/navmesh-pro, etc.
```

If the mod doesn't specify a pathfinder, it inherits whatever the player's experience profile selects. When specified, it overrides the experience profile's pathfinding axis — the same way `scenario.pathfinding.required` works (see "Scenario-Required Pathfinding" above), but at the mod level.

**Modder as author — providing a pathfinder:**

A Tier 3 WASM mod can implement the `Pathfinder` trait and register it as a new option:

```rust
// WASM mod: custom pathfinder (e.g., Generals-style layered grid)
impl Pathfinder for LayeredGridPathfinder {
    fn request_path(&mut self, origin: WorldPos, dest: WorldPos, locomotor: LocomotorType) -> PathId {
        // Surface bitmask check, zone reachability, A* with bridge layers
        // ...
    }
    fn get_path(&self, id: PathId) -> Option<&[WorldPos]> { /* ... */ }
    fn is_passable(&self, pos: WorldPos, locomotor: LocomotorType) -> bool { /* ... */ }
    fn invalidate_area(&mut self, center: WorldPos, radius: SimCoord) { /* ... */ }
}
```

The mod registers its pathfinder in its manifest with a YAML config block (like the built-in presets):

```yaml
# mod.yaml — community pathfinder distributed via Workshop
mod:
  name: "Generals Pathfinder"
  type: pathfinder                   # declares this mod provides a Pathfinder impl
  pathfinder_id: layered-grid-generals
  display_name: "Generals (Layered Grid)"
  description: "Grid pathfinding with bridge layers and surface bitmasks, inspired by C&C Generals"
  wasm_module: generals_pathfinder.wasm
  config:
    zone_block_size: 10
    bridge_clearance: 10.0
    surface_types: [ground, water, cliff, air, rubble]
```

Once installed, the community pathfinder appears alongside first-party presets in the lobby's Level 2 per-axis override ("Movement: Classic / OpenRA / Modern / Generals") and is selectable by other mods via `pathfinder: layered-grid-generals`.

**Workshop distribution:** Community pathfinders are Workshop resources (D030) like any other mod. They can be rated, reviewed, and depended upon. A total conversion mod declares `depends: community/generals-pathfinder@^1.0` and the engine auto-downloads it on lobby join (same as CS:GO-style auto-download).

**Sim-affecting implications:** Because pathfinding is deterministic and sim-affecting, all players in a multiplayer game must use the same pathfinder. A community pathfinder is synced like a first-party preset — the lobby validates that all clients have the same pathfinder WASM module (by SHA-256 hash), same config, same version.

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D013 (`Pathfinder` trait):** Each preset is a separate `Pathfinder` trait implementation. `RemastersPathfinder`, `OpenRaPathfinder`, and `IcPathfinder` are all registered by the RA1 game module. Community mods add more via WASM. The trait boundary serves triple duty: it separates algorithmic families (grid vs. navmesh), behavioral families (Classic vs. Modern), AND first-party from community-provided implementations.
- **D018 (`GameModule` trait):** The RA1 game module ships all three first-party pathfinder implementations. Community pathfinders are registered by the mod loader alongside them. The lobby's experience profile selection determines which one is active — `fn pathfinder()` returns whichever `Box<dyn Pathfinder>` was selected, whether first-party or community.
- **D019 (balance presets):** Parallel concept. Balance = what units can do. Pathfinding = how they get there. Both are sim-affecting, synced in multiplayer, and open to community alternatives.
- **D043 (AI presets):** Orthogonal. AI decides where to send units; pathfinding decides how they move. An AI preset + pathfinding preset combination determines overall movement behavior. Both are modder-selectable.
- **D033 (QoL toggles):** Some implementation-specific parameters (harvester stuck fix, infantry scatter smoothing) could be classified as QoL. Presets bundle them for consistency; individual toggles in advanced settings allow fine-tuning.
- **D048 (render modes):** Same modder-selectable pattern. Mods select or provide render modes; mods select or provide pathfinders. The trait-per-subsystem architecture means every pluggable system follows the same model.

### Alternatives Considered

- **One "best" pathfinding only** (rejected — Classic RA movement feel is part of the nostalgia and is critical for original scenario compatibility; forcing modern pathing on purists would alienate them AND break existing missions)
- **Pathfinding differences handled by balance presets** (rejected — movement behavior is fundamentally different from numeric values; a separate axis deserves separate selection)
- **One parameterized implementation that emulates all three** (rejected — Remastered pathfinding and IC flowfield pathfinding are fundamentally different algorithms with different data structures and different computational models; parameterizing one to approximate the other produces a neither-fish-nor-fowl result that reproduces neither accurately; separate implementations are honest and maintainable)
- **Only IC Default pathfinding, with "classic mode" as a cosmetic approximation** (rejected — scenario compatibility requires *actual* reproduction of original movement behavior, not an approximation; bridge missions, chokepoint defense, harvester timing all depend on specific pathfinding quirks)

## D046: Community Platform — Premium Content & Comprehensive Platform Integration

**Status:** Accepted
**Scope:** `ic-game`, `ic-ui`, Workshop infrastructure, platform SDK integration
**Phase:** Platform integration: Phase 5. Premium content framework: Phase 6a+.

### Context

D030 designs the Workshop resource registry including Steam Workshop as a source type. D035 designs voluntary creator tipping with explicit rejection of mandatory paid content. D036 designs the achievement system including Steam achievement sync. These decisions remain valid — D046 extends them in two directions that were previously out of scope:

1. **Premium content from official publishers** — allowing companies like EA to offer premium content (e.g., Remastered-quality art packs, soundtrack packs) through the Workshop, with proper licensing and revenue
2. **Comprehensive platform integration** — going beyond "Steam Workshop as a source" to full Steam platform compatibility (and other platforms: GOG, Epic, etc.)

### Decision

Extend the Workshop and platform layer to support *optional paid content from verified publishers* alongside the existing free ecosystem, and provide comprehensive platform service integration beyond just Workshop.

### Premium Content Framework

**Who can sell:** Only **verified publishers** — entities that have passed identity verification and (for copyrighted IP) provided proof of rights. This is NOT a general marketplace where any modder can charge money. The tipping model (D035) remains the primary creator recognition system.

**Use cases:**
- EA publishes Remastered Collection art assets (high-resolution sprites, remastered audio) as a premium resource pack. Players who own the Remastered Collection on Steam get it bundled; others can purchase separately.
- Professional content studios publish high-quality campaign packs, voice acting, or soundtrack packs.
- Tournament organizers sell premium cosmetic packs for event fundraising.

**What premium content CANNOT be:**
- **Gameplay-affecting.** No paid units, weapons, factions, or balance-changing content. Premium content is cosmetic or supplementary: art packs, soundtrack packs, voice packs, campaign packs (story content, not gameplay advantages).
- **Required for multiplayer.** No player can be excluded from a game because they don't own a premium pack. If a premium art pack is active, non-owners see the default sprites — never a "buy to play" gate.
- **Exclusive to one platform.** Premium content purchased through any platform is accessible from all platforms (subject to platform holder agreements).

| **DRM**                | **None.** IC is DRM-free always.     | DRM-free                    | DRM-free                  | DRM-free                       |
| **Premium purchases**  | Steam Commerce                       | GOG store                   | Epic store                | IC direct purchase (future)    |
| **Leaderboards**       | Steam leaderboards + IC leaderboards | IC leaderboards             | IC leaderboards           | IC leaderboards                |
| **Multiplayer**        | IC netcode (all platforms together)  | IC netcode                  | IC netcode                | IC netcode                     |

**Critical principle: All platforms play together.** IC's multiplayer is platform-agnostic (IC relay servers, D007). A Steam player, a GOG player, and a standalone player can all join the same lobby. Platform services (friends, invites, overlay) are convenience features — never multiplayer gates.

### Platform Abstraction Layer

The `PlatformServices` trait is defined in `ic-ui` (where platform-aware UI — friends list, invite buttons, achievement popups — lives). Concrete implementations (`SteamPlatform`, `GogPlatform`, `StandalonePlatform`) live in `ic-game` and are injected as a Bevy resource at startup. `ic-ui` accesses the trait via `Res<dyn PlatformServices>`.

```rust
/// Engine-side abstraction over platform services.
/// Defined in ic-ui; implementations in ic-game, injected as Bevy resource.
pub trait PlatformServices: Send + Sync {
    /// Sync an achievement unlock to the platform
    fn unlock_achievement(&self, id: &str) -> Result<(), PlatformError>;

    /// Set rich presence status
    fn set_presence(&self, status: &str, details: &PresenceDetails) -> Result<(), PlatformError>;

    /// Get friends list (for invite UI)
    fn friends_list(&self) -> Result<Vec<PlatformFriend>, PlatformError>;

    /// Invite a friend to the current lobby
    fn invite_friend(&self, friend: &PlatformFriend) -> Result<(), PlatformError>;

    /// Upload save to cloud storage
    fn cloud_save(&self, slot: &str, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), PlatformError>;

    /// Download save from cloud storage
    fn cloud_load(&self, slot: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, PlatformError>;

    /// Platform display name
    fn platform_name(&self) -> &str;
}
```

Implementations: `SteamPlatform` (via Steamworks SDK), `GogPlatform` (via GOG Galaxy SDK), `StandalonePlatform` (no-op or IC-native services).

### Monetization Model for Backend Services

D035 established that IC infrastructure has real hosting costs. D046 formalizes the backend monetization model:

| Revenue Source                   | Description                                                                           | D035 Alignment          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Community donations**          | Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors — existing model                                     | ✓ unchanged             |
| **Premium relay tier**           | Optional paid tier: priority queue, larger replay archive, custom clan pages          | ✓ D035                  |
| **Verified publisher fees**      | Publishers pay a listing fee + revenue share for premium Workshop content             | NEW — extends D035      |
| **Sponsored featured slots**     | Workshop featured section for promoted resources                                      | ✓ D035                  |
| **Platform store revenue share** | Steam/GOG/Epic take their standard cut on premium purchases made through their stores | NEW — platform standard |

**Free tier is always fully functional.** Premium content is cosmetic/supplementary. Backend monetization sustainably funds relay servers, tracking servers, and Workshop infrastructure without gating gameplay.

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D030 (Workshop):** D046 extends D030's schema with `pricing.model: premium` and `publisher.verified: true`. The Workshop architecture (federated, multi-source) supports premium content as another resource type.
- **D035 (Creator recognition):** D046 does NOT replace tipping. Individual modders use tips (D035). Verified publishers use premium pricing (D046). Both coexist — a modder can publish free mods with tip links AND work for a publisher that sells premium packs.
- **D036 (Achievements):** D046 formalizes the multi-platform achievement sync that D036 mentioned briefly ("Steam achievements sync for Steam builds").
- **D037 (Governance):** Premium content moderation, verified publisher approval, and revenue-related disputes fall under community governance (D037).

### Alternatives Considered

- No premium content ever (rejected — leaves money on the table for both the project and legitimate IP holders like EA; the Remastered art pack use case is too valuable)
- Open marketplace for all creators (rejected — Skyrim paid mods disaster; tips-only for individual creators, premium only for verified publishers)
- Platform-exclusive content (rejected — violates cross-platform play principle)
- IC processes all payments directly (rejected — regulatory burden, payment processing complexity; delegate to platform stores and existing payment processors)

## D047: LLM Configuration Manager — Provider Management & Community Sharing

**Status:** Accepted
**Scope:** `ic-ui`, `ic-llm`, `ic-game`
**Phase:** Phase 7 (ships with LLM features)

### The Problem

D016 established the BYOLLM architecture: users configure an `LlmProvider` (endpoint, API key, model name) in settings. But as LLM features expand across the engine — mission generation (D016), coaching (D042), AI orchestrator (D044), asset generation (D040) — managing provider configurations becomes non-trivial. Users may want:

- Multiple providers configured simultaneously (local Ollama for AI orchestrator speed, cloud API for high-quality mission generation)
- Task-specific routing (use a cheap model for real-time AI, expensive model for campaign generation)
- Sharing working configurations with the community (without sharing API keys)
- Discovering which models work well for which IC features
- An achievement for configuring and using LLM features (engagement incentive)

### Decision

Provide a dedicated **LLM Manager** UI screen and a community-shareable configuration format for LLM provider setups.

### LLM Manager UI

### Community-Shareable Configurations

LLM configurations can be exported (without API keys) and shared via the Workshop (D030):

```yaml
# Exported LLM configuration (shareable)
llm_config:
  name: "Budget-Friendly RA Setup"
  author: "PlayerName"
  description: "Ollama for real-time features, free API tier for generation"
  version: 1
  providers:
    - name: "Local Ollama"
      type: ollama
      endpoint: "http://localhost:11434"
      model: "llama3.2:8b"
      # NO api_key — never exported
    - name: "Cloud Provider"
      type: openai-compatible
      # endpoint intentionally omitted — user fills in their own
      model: "gpt-4o-mini"
      notes: "Works well with OpenAI or any compatible API"
  routing:
    ai_orchestrator: "Local Ollama"
    mission_generation: "Cloud Provider"
    coaching: "Local Ollama"
    campaign_briefings: "Cloud Provider"
    asset_generation: "Cloud Provider"
  performance_notes: |
    Tested on RTX 3060 + Ryzen 5600X.
    Ollama latency ~300ms for orchestrator (acceptable).
    GPT-4o-mini at ~$0.02 per mission generation.
  compatibility:
    ic_version: ">=0.5.0"
    tested_models:
      - "llama3.2:8b"
      - "mistral:7b"
      - "gpt-4o-mini"
      - "gpt-4o"
```

**Security:** API keys are **never** included in exported configurations. The export contains provider types, model names, and routing — the user fills in their own credentials after importing.

### Workshop Integration

LLM configurations are a Workshop resource type (D030):

- **Category:** "LLM Configurations" in the Workshop browser
- **Ratings and reviews:** Community rates configurations by reliability, cost, quality
- **Tagging:** `budget`, `high-quality`, `local-only`, `fast`, `creative`, `coaching`
- **Compatibility tracking:** Configurations specify which IC version and features they've been tested with

### Achievement Integration (D036)

LLM configuration is an achievement milestone — encouraging discovery and adoption:

| Achievement               | Trigger                                           | Category    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| "Intelligence Officer"    | Configure your first LLM provider                 | Community   |
| "Strategic Command"       | Win a game with LLM Orchestrator AI active        | Exploration |
| "Artificial Intelligence" | Play 10 games with any LLM-enhanced AI mode       | Exploration |
| "The Sharing Protocol"    | Publish an LLM configuration to the Workshop      | Community   |
| "Commanding General"      | Use task routing with 2+ providers simultaneously | Exploration |

### Storage (D034)

```sql
CREATE TABLE llm_providers (
    id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name        TEXT NOT NULL,
    type        TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'ollama', 'openai', 'anthropic', 'custom'
    endpoint    TEXT,
    model       TEXT NOT NULL,
    api_key     TEXT,                    -- encrypted at rest
    is_active   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at  TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_tested TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE llm_task_routing (
    task_name   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,        -- 'ai_orchestrator', 'mission_generation', etc.
    provider_id INTEGER REFERENCES llm_providers(id)
);
```

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D016 (BYOLLM):** D047 is the UI and management layer for D016's `LlmProvider` trait. D016 defined the trait and provider types; D047 provides the user experience for configuring them.
- **D036 (Achievements):** LLM-related achievements encourage exploration of optional features without making them required.
- **D030 (Workshop):** LLM configurations become another shareable resource type.
- **D034 (SQLite):** Provider configurations stored locally, encrypted API keys.
- **D044 (LLM AI):** The task routing table directly determines which provider the orchestrator and LLM player use.

### Alternatives Considered

- Settings-only configuration, no dedicated UI (rejected — multiple providers with task routing is too complex for a settings page)
- No community sharing (rejected — LLM configuration is a significant friction point; community knowledge sharing reduces the barrier)
- Include API keys in exports (rejected — obvious security risk; never export secrets)
- Centralized LLM service run by IC project (rejected — conflicts with BYOLLM principle; users control their own data and costs)

## D048: Switchable Render Modes — Classic, HD, and 3D in One Game

**Status:** Accepted
**Scope:** `ic-render`, `ic-game`, `ic-ui`
**Phase:** Phase 2 (render mode infrastructure), Phase 3 (toggle UI), Phase 6a (3D mode mod support)

### The Problem

The C&C Remastered Collection's most iconic UX feature is pressing F1 to instantly toggle between classic 320×200 sprites and hand-painted HD art — mid-game, no loading screen. This isn't just swapping sprites. It's switching the *entire visual presentation*: sprite resolution, palette handling, terrain tiles, shadow rendering, UI chrome, and scaling behavior. The engine already has pieces to support this (resource packs in `04-MODDING.md`, dual asset rendering in D029, `Renderable` trait, `ScreenToWorld` trait, 3D render mods in `02-ARCHITECTURE.md`), but they exist as independent systems with no unified mechanism for "switch everything at once." Furthermore, the current design treats 3D rendering exclusively as a Tier 3 WASM mod that **replaces** the default renderer — there's no concept of a game or mod that ships *both* 2D and 3D views and lets the player toggle between them.

### Decision

Introduce **render modes** as a first-class engine concept. A render mode bundles a rendering backend, camera system, resource pack selection, and visual configuration into a named, instantly-switchable unit. Game modules and mods can register multiple render modes; the player toggles between them with a keybind or settings menu.

### What a Render Mode Is

A render mode composes four concerns that must change together:

| Concern            | What Changes                                                     | Trait / System                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Render backend** | Sprite renderer vs. mesh renderer vs. voxel renderer             | `Renderable` impl                     |
| **Camera**         | Isometric orthographic vs. free 3D perspective; zoom range       | `ScreenToWorld` impl + `CameraConfig` |
| **Resource packs** | Which asset set to use (classic `.shp`, HD sprites, GLTF models) | Resource pack selection               |
| **Visual config**  | Scaling mode, palette handling, shadow style, post-FX preset     | `RenderSettings` subset               |

A render mode is NOT a game module. The simulation, pathfinding, networking, balance, and game rules are completely unchanged between modes. Two players in the same multiplayer game can use different render modes — the sim is view-agnostic (this is already an established architectural property).

### Render Mode Registration

Game modules register their supported render modes via the `GameModule` trait:

```rust
pub struct RenderMode {
    pub id: String,                        // "classic", "hd", "3d"
    pub display_name: String,              // "Classic (320×200)", "HD Sprites", "3D View"
    pub render_backend: RenderBackendId,   // Which Renderable impl to use
    pub camera: CameraMode,                // Isometric, Perspective, FreeRotate
    pub camera_config: CameraConfig,       // Zoom range, pan speed (see 02-ARCHITECTURE.md § Camera)
    pub resource_pack_overrides: Vec<ResourcePackRef>, // Per-category pack selections
    pub visual_config: VisualConfig,       // Scaling, palette, shadow, post-FX
    pub keybind: Option<KeyCode>,          // Optional dedicated toggle key
}

pub struct CameraConfig {
    pub zoom_min: f32,                     // minimum zoom (0.5 = zoomed way out)
    pub zoom_max: f32,                     // maximum zoom (4.0 = close-up)
    pub zoom_default: f32,                 // starting zoom level (1.0)
    pub integer_snap: bool,                // snap to integer scale for pixel art (Classic mode)
}

pub struct VisualConfig {
    pub scaling: ScalingMode,              // IntegerNearest, Bilinear, Native
    pub palette_mode: PaletteMode,         // IndexedPalette, DirectColor
    pub shadow_style: ShadowStyle,         // SpriteShadow, ProjectedShadow, None
    pub post_fx: PostFxPreset,             // None, Classic, Enhanced
}
```

The RA1 game module would register:

```yaml
render_modes:
  classic:
    display_name: "Classic"
    render_backend: sprite
    camera: isometric
    camera_config:
      zoom_min: 0.5
      zoom_max: 3.0
      zoom_default: 1.0
      integer_snap: true           # snap OrthographicProjection.scale to integer multiples
    resource_packs:
      sprites: classic-shp
      terrain: classic-tiles
    visual_config:
      scaling: integer_nearest
      palette_mode: indexed
      shadow_style: sprite_shadow
      post_fx: none
    description: "Original 320×200 pixel art, integer-scaled"

  hd:
    display_name: "HD"
    render_backend: sprite
    camera: isometric
    camera_config:
      zoom_min: 0.5
      zoom_max: 4.0
      zoom_default: 1.0
      integer_snap: false          # smooth zoom at all levels
    resource_packs:
      sprites: hd-sprites         # Requires HD sprite resource pack
      terrain: hd-terrain
    visual_config:
      scaling: native
      palette_mode: direct_color
      shadow_style: sprite_shadow
      post_fx: enhanced
    description: "High-definition sprites at native resolution"
```

A 3D render mod adds a third mode:

```yaml
# 3d_mod/render_modes.yaml (extends base game module)
render_modes:
  3d:
    display_name: "3D View"
    render_backend: mesh            # Provided by the WASM mod
    camera: free_rotate
    camera_config:
      zoom_min: 0.25               # 3D allows wider zoom range
      zoom_max: 6.0
      zoom_default: 1.0
      integer_snap: false
    resource_packs:
      sprites: 3d-models           # GLTF meshes mapped to unit types
      terrain: 3d-terrain
    visual_config:
      scaling: native
      palette_mode: direct_color
      shadow_style: projected_shadow
      post_fx: enhanced
    description: "Full 3D rendering with free camera"
    requires_mod: "3d-ra"          # Only available when this mod is loaded
```

### Toggle Mechanism

**Default keybind:** F1 cycles through available render modes (matching the Remastered Collection). A game with only `classic` and `hd` modes: F1 toggles between them. A game with three modes: F1 cycles classic → hd → 3d → classic. The cycle order matches the `render_modes` declaration order.

**Settings UI:**

```
Settings → Graphics → Render Mode
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Active Render Mode:  [HD ▾]                   │

└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Modes whose required resource packs or mods aren't installed remain clickable — selecting one opens a guidance panel explaining what's needed and linking directly to Workshop or settings (see D033 § "UX Principle: No Dead-End Buttons"). No greyed-out entries.

### How the Switch Works (Runtime)

The toggle is instant — no loading screen, no fade-to-black for same-backend switches:

1. **Same render backend** (classic ↔ hd): Swap `Handle` references on all `Renderable` components. Both asset sets are loaded at startup (or on first toggle). Bevy's asset system makes this a single-frame operation — exactly like the Remastered Collection's F1.

2. **Different render backend** (2D ↔ 3D): Swap the active `Renderable` implementation and camera. This is heavier — the first switch loads the 3D asset set (brief loading indicator). Subsequent switches are instant because both backends stay resident. Camera interpolates smoothly between isometric and perspective over ~0.3 seconds.

3. **Multiplayer**: Render mode is a client-only setting. The sim doesn't know or care. No sync, no lobby lock. One player on Classic, one on HD, one on 3D — all in the same game. This already works architecturally; D048 just formalizes it.

4. **Replays**: Render mode is switchable during replay playback. Watch a classic-era replay in 3D, or vice versa.

### Cross-View Multiplayer

This deserves emphasis because it's a feature no shipped C&C game has offered: **players using different visual presentations in the same multiplayer match.** The sim/render split (Invariant #1, #9) makes this free. A competitive player who prefers classic pixel clarity plays against someone using 3D — same rules, same sim, same balance, different eyes.

Cross-view also means **cross-view spectating**: an observer can watch a tournament match in 3D while the players compete in classic 2D. This creates unique content creation and broadcasting opportunities.

### Information Equivalence Across Render Modes

Cross-view multiplayer is competitively safe because all render modes display **identical game-state information:**

- **Fog of war:** Visibility is computed by `FogProvider` in the sim. Every render mode receives the same `VisibilityGrid` — no mode can reveal fogged units or terrain that another mode hides.
- **Unit visibility:** Cloaked, burrowed, and disguised units are shown/hidden based on sim-side detection state (`DetectCloaked`, `IgnoresDisguise`). The render mode determines *how* a shimmer or disguise looks, not *whether* the player sees it.
- **Health bars, status indicators, minimap:** All driven by sim state. A unit at 50% health shows 50% health in every render mode. Minimap icons are derived from the same entity positions regardless of visual presentation.
- **Selection and targeting:** Click hitboxes are defined per render mode via `ScreenToWorld`, but the available actions and information (tooltip, stats panel) are identical.

If a future render mode creates an information asymmetry (e.g., 3D terrain occlusion that hides units behind buildings when the 2D mode shows them), the mode must equalize information display — either by adding a visibility indicator or by using the sim's visibility grid as the authority for what's shown. **The principle: render modes change how the game looks, never what the player knows.**

### Relationship to Existing Systems

| System                   | Before D048                                          | After D048                                                                                           |

| **Resource Packs**       | Per-category asset selection in Settings             | Resource packs become a *component* of render modes; the mode auto-selects the right packs           |
| **D029 Dual Asset**      | Dual asset handles per entity                        | Generalized to N render modes, not just two. D029's mechanism is how same-backend switches work      |

| **Render Quality Tiers** | Hardware-adaptive Baseline → Ultra                   | Tiers apply *within* a render mode. Classic mode on Tier 0 hardware; 3D mode requires Tier 2 minimum |
| **Experience Profiles**  | Balance + theme + QoL + AI + pathfinding             | Now also include a default render mode                                                               |

### What Mod Authors Need to Do

**For a sprite HD pack** (most common case): Nothing new. Publish a resource pack with HD sprites. The game module's `hd` render mode references it. The player installs it and F1 toggles.

**For a 3D rendering mod** (Tier 3): Ship a WASM mod that provides a `Renderable` impl (mesh renderer) and a `ScreenToWorld` impl (3D camera). Declare a render mode in YAML that references these implementations and the 3D asset resource packs. The engine registers the mode alongside the built-in modes — F1 now cycles through all three.

**For a complete 3D game module** (e.g., Generals clone): The game module can register only 3D render modes — no classic 2D at all. Or it can ship both. The architecture supports any combination.

### Minimum Viable Scope

Phase 2 delivers the infrastructure — render mode registration, asset handle swapping, the `RenderMode` struct. The HD/SD toggle (classic ↔ hd) works. Phase 3 adds the settings UI and keybind. Phase 6a supports mod-provided render modes (3D). The architecture supports all of this from day one; the phases gate what's *tested and polished.*

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Resource packs only, no render mode concept** — Rejected. Switching from 2D to 3D requires changing the render backend and camera, not just assets. Resource packs can't do that.
2. **3D as a separate game module** — Rejected. A "3D RA1" game module would duplicate all the rules, balance, and systems from the base RA1 module. The whole point is that the sim is unchanged.
3. **No 2D↔3D toggle; 3D replaces 2D permanently when mod is active** — Rejected. The Remastered Collection proved that *toggling* is the feature, not just having two visual options. Players love comparing. Content creators use it for dramatic effect. It's also a safety net — if the 3D mod has rendering bugs, you can toggle back.

### Lessons from the Remastered Collection

The Remastered Collection's F1 toggle is the gold-standard reference for this feature. Its architecture — recovered from the GPL source (`DLLInterface.cpp`) and our analysis (`research/remastered-collection-netcode-analysis.md` § 9) — reveals how Petroglyph achieved instant switching, and where IC can improve:

**How the Remastered toggle works internally:**

The Remastered Collection runs **two rendering pipelines in parallel.** The original C++ engine still software-renders every frame to `GraphicBufferClass` RAM buffers (palette-based 8-bit blitting) — exactly as in 1995. Simultaneously, `DLL_Draw_Intercept` captures every draw call as structured metadata (`CNCObjectStruct`: position, type, shape index, frame, palette, cloak state, health, selection) and forwards it to the C# GlyphX client via `CNC_Get_Game_State()`. The GlyphX layer renders the same scene using HD art and GPU acceleration. When the player presses Tab (their toggle key), the C# layer simply switches which final framebuffer is composited to screen — the classic software buffer or the HD GPU buffer. Both are always up-to-date because both render every frame.

**Why dual-render works for Remastered but is wrong for IC:**

| Remastered approach                                      | IC approach                                     | Why different                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Both pipelines render every frame                        | Only the active mode renders                    | The Remastered C++ engine is a sealed DLL — you can't stop it rendering. IC owns both pipelines and can skip work. Rendering both wastes GPU budget. |
| Classic renderer is software (CPU blit to RAM)           | Both modes are GPU-based (wgpu via Bevy)        | Classic-mode GPU sprites are cheap but not free. Dual GPU render passes halve available GPU budget for post-FX, particles, unit count.               |
| Switch is trivial: flip a "which buffer to present" flag | Switch swaps asset handles on live entities     | Remastered pays for dual-render continuously to make the flip trivial. IC pays nothing continuously and does a one-frame swap at toggle time.        |
| Two codebases: C++ (classic) and C# (HD)                 | One codebase: same Bevy systems, different data | IC's approach is fundamentally lighter — same draw call dispatch, different texture atlases.                                                         |

**Key insight IC adopts:** The Remastered Collection's critical architectural win is that **the sim is completely unaware of the render switch.** The C++ sim DLL (`CNC_Advance_Instance`) has no knowledge of which visual mode is active — it advances identically in both cases. IC inherits this principle via Invariant #1 (sim is pure). The sim never imports from `ic-render`. Render mode is a purely client-side concern.

**Key insight IC rejects:** Dual-rendering every frame is wasteful when you own both pipelines. The Remastered Collection pays this cost because the C++ DLL cannot be told "don't render this frame" — `DLL_Draw_Intercept` fires unconditionally. IC has no such constraint. Only the active render mode's systems should run.

### Bevy Implementation Strategy

The render mode switch is implementable entirely within Bevy's existing architecture — no custom render passes, no engine modifications. The key mechanisms are **`Visibility` component toggling**, **`Handle` swapping on `Sprite`/`Mesh` components**, and **Bevy's system set run conditions**.

#### Architecture: Two Approaches, One Hybrid

**Approach A: Entity-per-mode (rejected for same-backend switches)**

Spawn separate sprite entities for classic and HD, toggle `Visibility`. Simple but doubles entity count (500 units × 2 = 1000 sprite entities) and doubles `Transform` sync work. Only justified for cross-backend switches (2D entity + 3D entity) where the components are structurally different.

**Approach B: Handle-swap on shared entity (adopted for same-backend switches)**

Each renderable entity has one `Sprite` component. On toggle, swap its `Handle<Image>` (or `TextureAtlas` index) from the classic atlas to the HD atlas. One entity, one transform, one visibility check — the sprite batch simply references different texture data. This is what `D029 Dual Asset` already designed.

**Hybrid: same-backend swaps use handle-swap; cross-backend swaps use visibility-gated entity groups.**

#### Core ECS Components

```rust
/// Marker resource: the currently active render mode.
/// Changed via F1 keypress or settings UI.
/// Bevy change detection (Res<ActiveRenderMode>.is_changed()) triggers swap systems.
#[derive(Resource)]
pub struct ActiveRenderMode {
    pub current: RenderModeId,       // "classic", "hd", "3d"
    pub cycle: Vec<RenderModeId>,    // Ordered list for F1 cycling
    pub registry: HashMap<RenderModeId, RenderModeConfig>,
}

/// Per-entity component: maps this entity's render data for each available mode.
/// Populated at spawn time from the game module's YAML asset mappings.
#[derive(Component)]
pub struct RenderModeAssets {
    /// For same-backend modes (classic ↔ hd): alternative texture handles.
    /// Key = render mode id, Value = handle to that mode's texture atlas.
    pub sprite_handles: HashMap<RenderModeId, Handle<Image>>,
    /// For same-backend modes: alternative atlas layout indices.
    pub atlas_mappings: HashMap<RenderModeId, TextureAtlasLayout>,
    /// For cross-backend modes (2D ↔ 3D): entity IDs of the alternative representations.
    /// These entities exist but have Visibility::Hidden until their mode activates.
    pub cross_backend_entities: HashMap<RenderModeId, Entity>,
}

/// System set that only runs when a render mode switch just occurred.
/// Uses Bevy's run_if condition to avoid any per-frame cost when not switching.
#[derive(SystemSet, Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct RenderModeSwitchSet;
```

#### The Toggle System (F1 Handler)

```rust
/// Runs every frame (cheap: one key check).
fn handle_render_mode_toggle(
    input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>,
    mut active: ResMut<ActiveRenderMode>,
) {
    if input.just_pressed(KeyCode::F1) {
        let idx = active.cycle.iter()
            .position(|id| *id == active.current)
            .unwrap_or(0);
        let next = (idx + 1) % active.cycle.len();
        active.current = active.cycle[next].clone();
        // Bevy change detection fires: active.is_changed() == true this frame.
        // All systems in RenderModeSwitchSet will run exactly once.
    }
}
```

#### Same-Backend Swap (Classic ↔ HD)

```rust
/// Runs ONLY when ActiveRenderMode changes (run_if condition).
/// Cost: iterates all renderable entities ONCE, swaps Handle + atlas.
/// For 500 units + 200 buildings + terrain = ~1000 entities: < 0.5ms.
fn swap_sprite_handles(
    active: Res<ActiveRenderMode>,
    mut query: Query<(&RenderModeAssets, &mut Sprite)>,
) {
    let mode = &active.current;
    for (assets, mut sprite) in &mut query {
        if let Some(handle) = assets.sprite_handles.get(mode) {
            sprite.image = handle.clone();
        }
        // Atlas layout swap happens similarly via TextureAtlas component
    }
}

/// Swap camera and visual settings when render mode changes.
/// Updates the GameCamera zoom range and the OrthographicProjection scaling mode.
/// Camera position is preserved across switches — only zoom behavior changes.
/// See 02-ARCHITECTURE.md § "Camera System" for the canonical GameCamera resource.
fn swap_visual_config(
    active: Res<ActiveRenderMode>,
    mut game_camera: ResMut<GameCamera>,
    mut camera_query: Query<&mut OrthographicProjection, With<GameCameraMarker>>,
) {
    let config = &active.registry[&active.current];

    // Update zoom range from the new render mode's camera config.
    game_camera.zoom_min = config.camera_config.zoom_min;
    game_camera.zoom_max = config.camera_config.zoom_max;
    // Clamp current zoom to new range (e.g., 3D mode allows wider range than Classic).
    game_camera.zoom_target = game_camera.zoom_target
        .clamp(game_camera.zoom_min, game_camera.zoom_max);

    for mut proj in &mut camera_query {
        proj.scaling_mode = match config.visual_config.scaling {
            ScalingMode::IntegerNearest => bevy::render::camera::ScalingMode::Fixed {
                width: 320.0, height: 200.0, // Classic RA viewport
            },
            ScalingMode::Native => bevy::render::camera::ScalingMode::AutoMin {
                min_width: 1280.0, min_height: 720.0,
            },
            // ...
        };
    }
}
```

#### Cross-Backend Swap (2D ↔ 3D)

```rust
/// For cross-backend switches: toggle Visibility on entity groups.
/// The 3D entities exist from the start but are Hidden.
/// Swap cost: iterate entities, flip Visibility enum. Still < 1ms.
fn swap_render_backends(
    active: Res<ActiveRenderMode>,
    mut query: Query<(&RenderModeAssets, &mut Visibility)>,
    mut cross_entities: Query<&mut Visibility, Without<RenderModeAssets>>,
) {
    let mode = &active.current;
    let config = &active.registry[mode];

    for (assets, mut vis) in &mut query {
        // If this entity's backend matches the active mode, show it.
        // Otherwise, hide it and show the cross-backend counterpart.
        if assets.sprite_handles.contains_key(mode) {
            *vis = Visibility::Inherited;
            // Hide cross-backend counterparts
            for (other_mode, &entity) in &assets.cross_backend_entities {
                if *other_mode != *mode {
                    if let Ok(mut other_vis) = cross_entities.get_mut(entity) {
                        *other_vis = Visibility::Hidden;
                    }
                }
            }
        } else if let Some(&entity) = assets.cross_backend_entities.get(mode) {
            *vis = Visibility::Hidden;
            if let Ok(mut other_vis) = cross_entities.get_mut(entity) {
                *other_vis = Visibility::Inherited;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### System Scheduling

```rust
impl Plugin for RenderModePlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.init_resource::<ActiveRenderMode>()
           // F1 handler runs every frame — trivially cheap (one key check).
           .add_systems(Update, handle_render_mode_toggle)
           // Swap systems run ONLY on the frame when ActiveRenderMode changes.
           .add_systems(Update, (
               swap_sprite_handles,
               swap_visual_config,
               swap_render_backends,
               swap_ui_theme,            // D032 theme pairing
               swap_post_fx_pipeline,    // Post-processing preset
               emit_render_mode_event,   // Telemetry: D031
           ).in_set(RenderModeSwitchSet)
            .run_if(resource_changed::<ActiveRenderMode>));
    }
}
```

#### Performance Characteristics

| Operation                        | Cost                                      | When It Runs         | Notes                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F1 key check                     | ~0 (one `HashMap` lookup)                 | Every frame          | Bevy input system already processes keys; we just read                                                         |
| Same-backend swap (classic ↔ hd) | ~0.3–0.5 ms for 1000 entities             | Once on toggle       | Iterate entities, write `Handle<Image>`. No GPU work. Bevy batches texture changes automatically on next draw. |
| Cross-backend swap (2D ↔ 3D)     | ~0.5–1 ms for 1000 entity pairs           | Once on toggle       | Toggle `Visibility`. Hidden entities are culled by Bevy's visibility system — zero draw calls.                 |
| 3D asset first-load              | 50–500 ms (one-time)                      | First toggle to 3D   | GLTF meshes + textures loaded async by Bevy's asset server. Brief loading indicator. Cached thereafter.        |
| Steady-state (non-toggle frames) | **0 ms**                                  | Every frame          | `run_if(resource_changed)` gates all swap systems. Zero per-frame overhead.                                    |
| VRAM usage                       | Classic atlas (~8 MB) + HD atlas (~64 MB) | Resident when loaded | Both atlases stay in VRAM. Modern GPUs: trivial. Min-spec 512 MB VRAM: still <15%.                             |

**Key property: zero per-frame cost.** Bevy's `resource_changed` run condition means the swap systems literally do not execute unless the player presses F1. Between toggles, the renderer treats the active atlas as the only atlas — standard sprite batching, standard draw calls, no branching.

#### Asset Pre-Loading Strategy

The critical difference from the Remastered Collection: IC does NOT dual-render. Instead, it pre-loads both texture atlases into VRAM at match start (or lazily on first toggle):

```rust
/// Called during match loading. Pre-loads all registered render mode assets.
fn preload_render_mode_assets(
    active: Res<ActiveRenderMode>,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    mut preload_handles: ResMut<RenderModePreloadHandles>,
) {
    for (mode_id, config) in &active.registry {
        for pack_ref in &config.resource_pack_overrides {
            // Bevy's asset server loads asynchronously.
            // We hold the Handle to keep the asset resident in memory.
            let handle = asset_server.load(pack_ref.atlas_path());
            preload_handles.retain.push(handle);
        }
    }
}
```

**Loading strategy by mode type:**

| Mode pair                   | Pre-load?             | Memory cost               | Rationale                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Classic ↔ HD (same backend) | Yes, at match start   | +64 MB VRAM for HD atlas  | Both are texture atlases. Pre-loading makes F1 instant.                                    |
| 2D ↔ 3D (cross backend)     | Lazy, on first toggle | +100–300 MB for 3D meshes | 3D assets are large. Don't penalize 2D-only players. Loading indicator on first 3D toggle. |
| Any ↔ Any (menu/lobby)      | Active mode only      | Minimal                   | No gameplay; loading time acceptable.                                                      |

#### Transform Synchronization (Cross-Backend Only)

When 2D and 3D entities coexist (one hidden), their `Transform` must stay in sync so the switch looks seamless. The sim writes to a `SimPosition` component (in world coordinates). Both the 2D sprite entity and the 3D mesh entity read from the same `SimPosition` and compute their own `Transform`:

```rust
/// Runs every frame for ALL visible renderable entities.
/// Converts SimPosition → entity Transform using the active camera model.
/// Hidden entities skip this (Bevy's visibility propagation prevents
/// transform updates on Hidden entities from triggering GPU uploads).
fn sync_render_transforms(
    active: Res<ActiveRenderMode>,
    mut query: Query<(&SimPosition, &mut Transform), With<Visibility>>,
) {
    let camera_model = &active.registry[&active.current].camera;
    for (sim_pos, mut transform) in &mut query {
        *transform = camera_model.world_to_render(sim_pos);
    }
}
```

Bevy's built-in visibility system already ensures that `Hidden` entities' transforms aren't uploaded to the GPU, so the 3D entity transforms are only computed when 3D mode is active.

#### Comparison: Remastered vs. IC Render Switch

| Aspect                    | Remastered Collection                                             | Iron Curtain                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**          | Dual-render: both pipelines run every frame                       | Single-render: only active mode draws             |
| **Switch cost**           | ~0 (flip framebuffer pointer)                                     | ~0.5 ms (swap handles on ~1000 entities)          |
| **Steady-state cost**     | Full classic render every frame (~2-5ms CPU) even when showing HD | **0 ms** — inactive mode has zero cost            |
| **Why the trade-off**     | C++ DLL can't be told "don't render"                              | IC owns both pipelines, can skip work             |
| **Memory**                | Classic (RAM buffer) + HD (VRAM)                                  | Both atlases in VRAM (unified GPU memory)         |
| **Cross-backend (2D↔3D)** | Not supported                                                     | Supported via visibility-gated entity groups      |
| **Multiplayer**           | Both players must use same mode                                   | Cross-view: each player picks independently       |

## D049: Workshop Asset Formats & Distribution — Bevy-Native Canonical, P2P Delivery

**Decision:** The Workshop's canonical asset formats are **Bevy-native modern formats** (OGG, PNG, WAV, WebM, KTX2, GLTF). C&C legacy formats (.aud, .shp, .pal, .vqa, .mix) are fully supported for backward compatibility but are not the recommended distribution format for new content. Workshop delivery uses **peer-to-peer distribution** (BitTorrent/WebTorrent protocol) with HTTP fallback, reducing hosting costs from CDN-level to a lightweight tracker.

> **Note (D050):** The format recommendations in this section are **IC-specific** — they reflect Bevy's built-in asset pipeline. The Workshop's P2P distribution protocol and package format are engine-agnostic (see D050). Future projects consuming the Workshop core library will define their own format recommendations based on their engine's capabilities. The `.icpkg` extension, `ic mod` CLI commands, and `game_module` manifest fields are likewise IC-specific — the Workshop core library uses configurable equivalents.

### The Format Problem

The engine serves two audiences with conflicting format needs:

1. **Legacy community:** Thousands of existing .shp, .aud, .mix, .pal assets. OpenRA mods. Original game files. These must load.
2. **New content creators:** Making sprites in Aseprite/Photoshop, recording audio in Audacity/Reaper, editing video in DaVinci Resolve. These tools export PNG, OGG, WAV, WebM — not .shp or .aud.

Forcing new creators to encode into C&C formats creates unnecessary friction. Forcing legacy content through format converters before it can load breaks the "community's existing work is sacred" invariant. The answer is: **accept both, recommend modern.**

### Canonical Format Recommendations

| Asset Type      | Workshop Format (new content)     | Legacy Support (existing) | Runtime Decode         | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Music**       | OGG Vorbis (128–320kbps)          | .aud (ra-formats decode)  | PCM via rodio          | Bevy default feature, excellent quality/size ratio, open/patent-free, WASM-safe. OGG at 192kbps ≈ 1.4MB/min vs .aud at ~0.5MB/min but dramatically higher quality (stereo, 44.1kHz vs mono 22kHz) |
| **SFX**         | WAV (16-bit PCM) or OGG           | .aud (ra-formats decode)  | PCM via rodio          | WAV = zero decode latency for gameplay-critical sounds (weapon fire, explosions). OGG for larger ambient/UI sounds where decode latency is acceptable                                             |
| **Voice**       | OGG Vorbis (96–128kbps)           | .aud (ra-formats decode)  | PCM via rodio          | Speech compresses well. OGG at 96kbps is transparent for voice. EVA packs with 200+ lines stay under 30MB                                                                                         |
| **Sprites**     | PNG (RGBA, indexed, or truecolor) | .shp+.pal (ra-formats)    | GPU texture via Bevy   | Bevy-native via `image` crate. Lossless. Every art tool exports it. Palette-indexed PNG preserves classic aesthetic. HD packs use truecolor RGBA                                                  |
| **HD Textures** | KTX2 (GPU-compressed: BC7/ASTC)   | N/A                       | Zero-cost GPU upload   | Bevy-native. No decode — GPU reads directly. Best runtime performance. `ic mod build` can batch-convert PNG→KTX2 for release builds                                                               |
| **Terrain**     | PNG tiles (indexed or RGBA)       | .tmp+.pal (ra-formats)    | GPU texture            | Same as sprites. Theater tilesets are sprite sheets                                                                                                                                               |
| **Cutscenes**   | WebM (VP9, 720p–1080p)            | .vqa (ra-formats decode)  | Frame→texture (custom) | Open, royalty-free, browser-compatible (WASM target). VP9 achieves ~5MB/min at 720p. Neither WebM nor VQA is Bevy-native — both need custom decode, so no advantage to VQA here                   |
| **3D Models**   | GLTF/GLB                          | N/A (future: .vxl)        | Bevy mesh              | Bevy's native 3D format. Community 3D mods (D048) use this                                                                                                                                        |
| **Palettes**    | .pal (768 bytes) or PNG strip     | .pal (ra-formats)         | Palette texture        | .pal is already tiny and universal in the C&C community. No reason to change. PNG strip is an alternative for tools that don't understand .pal                                                    |
| **Maps**        | IC YAML (native)                  | .oramap (ZIP+MiniYAML)    | ECS world state        | Already designed (D025, D026)                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Why Modern Formats as Default

**Bevy integration:** OGG, WAV, PNG, KTX2, and GLTF load through Bevy's built-in asset pipeline with zero custom code. Every Bevy feature — hot-reload, asset dependencies, async loading, platform abstraction — works automatically. C&C formats require custom `AssetLoader` implementations in ra-formats with manual integration into Bevy's pipeline.

**Security:** OGG (lewton/rodio), PNG (image crate), and WebM decoders in the Rust ecosystem have been fuzz-tested and used in production by thousands of projects. Browser vendors (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) have security-audited these formats for decades. Our .aud/.shp/.vqa parsers in ra-formats are custom code that has never been independently security-audited. For Workshop content downloaded from untrusted sources, mature parsers with established security track records are strictly safer. C&C format parsers use `BoundedReader` (see `06-SECURITY.md`), but defense in depth favors formats with deeper audit history.

**Multi-game:** Non-C&C game modules (D039) won't use .shp or .aud at all. A tower defense mod, a naval RTS, a Dune-inspired game — these ship PNG sprites and OGG audio. The Workshop serves all game modules, not just the C&C family.

**Tooling:** Every image editor saves PNG. Every DAW exports WAV/OGG. Every video editor exports WebM/MP4. Nobody's toolchain outputs .aud or .shp. Requiring C&C formats forces creators through a conversion step before they can publish — unnecessary friction.

**WASM/browser:** OGG and PNG work in Bevy's WASM builds out of the box. C&C formats need custom WASM decoders compiled into the browser bundle.

**Storage efficiency comparison:**

| Content                        | C&C Format                      | Modern Format                        | Notes                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3min music track               | .aud: ~1.5MB (22kHz mono ADPCM) | OGG: ~2.8MB (44.1kHz stereo 128kbps) | OGG is 2× larger but dramatically higher quality. At mono 22kHz OGG: ~0.7MB |
| Full soundtrack (30 tracks)    | .aud: ~45MB                     | OGG 128kbps: ~84MB                   | Acceptable for modern bandwidth/storage                                     |
| Unit sprite sheet (200 frames) | .shp+.pal: ~50KB                | PNG indexed: ~80KB                   | PNG slightly larger but universal tooling                                   |
| HD sprite sheet (200 frames)   | N/A (.shp can't do HD)          | PNG RGBA: ~500KB                     | Only modern format option for HD content                                    |
| 3min cutscene (720p)           | .vqa: ~15MB                     | WebM VP9: ~15MB                      | Comparable. WebM quality is higher at same bitrate                          |

Modern formats are somewhat larger for legacy-quality content but the difference is small relative to modern storage and bandwidth. For HD content, modern formats are the only option.

### The Conversion Escape Hatch

The Asset Studio (D040) converts in both directions:
- **Import:** .aud/.shp/.vqa/.pal → OGG/PNG/WebM/.pal (for modders working with legacy assets)
- **Export:** OGG/PNG/WebM → .aud/.shp/.vqa (for modders targeting OpenRA compatibility or classic aesthetic)
- **Batch convert:** `ic mod convert --to-modern` or `ic mod convert --to-classic` converts entire mod directories

The engine loads both format families at runtime. `ra-formats` decoders handle legacy formats; Bevy's built-in loaders handle modern formats. No manual conversion is ever required — only recommended for new Workshop publications.

### Workshop Package Format (.icpkg)

Workshop packages are **ZIP archives** with a standardized manifest — the same pattern as `.oramap` but generalized to any resource type:

```
my-hd-sprites-1.2.0.icpkg          # ZIP archive
├── manifest.yaml                    # Package metadata (required)
├── README.md                        # Long description (optional)
├── CHANGELOG.md                     # Version history (optional)
├── preview.png                      # Thumbnail, max 512×512 (required for Workshop listing)
└── assets/                          # Actual content files
    ├── sprites/
    │   ├── infantry-allied.png
    │   └── vehicles-soviet.png
    └── palettes/
        └── temperate-hd.pal
```

**manifest.yaml:**
```yaml
package:
  name: "hd-allied-sprites"
  publisher: "community-hd-project"
  version: "1.2.0"
  license: "CC-BY-SA-4.0"
  description: "HD sprite replacements for Allied infantry and vehicles"
  category: sprites
  game_module: ra1
  engine_version: "^0.3.0"

  # Per-file integrity (verified on install)
  files:
    sprites/infantry-allied.png:
      sha256: "a1b2c3d4..."
      size: 524288
    sprites/vehicles-soviet.png:
      sha256: "e5f6a7b8..."
      size: 1048576

  dependencies:
    - id: "community-hd-project/base-palettes"
      version: "^1.0"

  # P2P distribution metadata (added by Workshop server on publish)
  distribution:
    sha256: "full-package-hash..."        # Hash of entire .icpkg
    size: 1572864                          # Total package size in bytes
    infohash: "btih:abc123def..."          # BitTorrent info hash (for P2P)
```

ZIP was chosen over tar.gz because: random access to individual files (no full decompression to read manifest.yaml), universal tooling, `.oramap` precedent, and Rust's `zip` crate is mature.

**VPK-style indexed manifest (from Valve Source Engine):** The `.icpkg` manifest (manifest.yaml) is placed at the **start** of the archive, not at the end. This follows Valve's VPK (Valve Pak) format design, where the directory/index appears at the beginning of the file — allowing tools to read metadata, file listings, and dependencies without downloading or decompressing the entire package. For Workshop browsing, the tracker can serve just the first ~4KB of a package (the manifest) to populate search results, preview images, and dependency resolution without fetching the full archive. ZIP's central directory is at the *end* of the file, so ZIP-based `.icpkg` files include a redundant manifest at offset 0 (outside the ZIP structure, in a fixed-size header) for fast remote reads, with the canonical copy inside the ZIP for standard tooling compatibility. See `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 6.4.

**Content-addressed asset deduplication (from Valve Fossilize):** Workshop asset storage uses **content-addressed hashing** for deduplication — each file is identified by `SHA-256(content)`, not by path or name. When a modder publishes a new version that changes only 2 of 50 files, only the 2 changed files are uploaded; the remaining 48 reference existing content hashes already in the Workshop. This reduces upload size, storage cost, and download time for updates. The pattern comes from Fossilize's content hashing (FOSS_BLOB_HASH = SHA-256 of serialized data, see `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 3.2) and is also used by Git (content-addressed object store), Docker (layer deduplication), and IPFS (CID-based storage). The per-file SHA-256 hashes already present in manifest.yaml serve as content addresses — no additional metadata needed.

**Local cache CAS deduplication:** The same content-addressed pattern extends to the player's local `workshop/` directory. Instead of storing raw `.icpkg` ZIP files — where 10 mods bundling the same HD sprite pack each contain a separate copy — the Workshop client unpacks downloaded packages into a **content-addressed blob store** (`workshop/blobs/<sha256-prefix>/<sha256>`). Each installed package's manifest maps logical file paths to blob hashes; the package directory contains only symlinks or lightweight references to the shared blob store. Benefits:

- **Disk savings:** Popular shared resources (HD sprite packs, sound effect libraries, font packs) stored once regardless of how many mods depend on them. Ten mods using the same 200MB HD pack → 200MB stored, not 2GB.
- **Faster installs:** When installing a new mod, the client checks blob hashes against the local store before downloading. Files already present (from other mods) are skipped — only genuinely new content is fetched.
- **Atomic updates:** Updating a mod replaces only changed blob references. Unchanged files (same hash) are already in the store.
- **Garbage collection:** `ic mod gc` removes blobs no longer referenced by any installed package. Runs automatically during Workshop cleanup prompts (D030 budget system).

```
workshop/
├── cache.db              # Package metadata, manifests, dependency graph
├── blobs/                # Content-addressed blob store
│   ├── a1/a1b2c3...     # SHA-256 hash → file content
│   ├── d4/d4e5f6...
│   └── ...
└── packages/             # Per-package manifests (references into blobs/)
    ├── alice--hd-sprites-2.0.0/
    │   └── manifest.yaml # Maps logical paths → blob hashes
    └── bob--desert-map-1.1.0/
        └── manifest.yaml
```

The local CAS store is an optimization that ships alongside the full Workshop in Phase 6a. The initial Workshop (Phase 4–5) can use simpler `.icpkg`-on-disk storage and upgrade to CAS when the full Workshop matures — the manifest.yaml already contains per-file SHA-256 hashes, so the data model is forward-compatible.

### P2P Distribution (BitTorrent/WebTorrent)

**The cost problem:** A popular 500MB mod downloaded 10,000 times generates 5TB of egress. At CDN rates ($0.01–0.09/GB), that's $50–450/month — per mod. For a community project sustained by donations, centralized hosting is financially unsustainable at scale. A BitTorrent tracker VPS costs $5–20/month regardless of popularity.

**The solution:** Workshop distribution uses the **BitTorrent protocol** for large packages, with HTTP direct download as fallback. The Workshop server acts as both metadata registry (SQLite, lightweight) and BitTorrent tracker (peer coordination, lightweight). Actual content transfer happens peer-to-peer between players who have the package.

**How it works:**

```
┌─────────────┐     1. Search/browse     ┌──────────────────┐
│  ic CLI /    │ ───────────────────────► │  Workshop Server │
│  In-Game     │ ◄─────────────────────── │  (metadata +     │
│  Browser     │  2. manifest.yaml +      │   tracker)       │
│              │     torrent info         │                  │
│              │                          └──────────────────┘
│              │     3. P2P download
│              │ ◄──────────────────────► Other players (peers/seeds)
│              │     (BitTorrent protocol)
│              │
│              │     4. Fallback: HTTP direct download
│              │ ◄─────────────────────── Workshop server / mirrors / seed box
└─────────────┘     5. Verify SHA-256
```

1. **Publish:** `ic mod publish` uploads .icpkg to Workshop server. Server computes SHA-256, generates torrent metadata (info hash), starts seeding the package alongside any initial seed infrastructure.
2. **Browse/Search:** Workshop server handles all metadata queries (search, dependency resolution, ratings) via the existing SQLite + FTS5 design. Lightweight.
3. **Install:** `ic mod install` fetches the manifest from the server, then downloads the .icpkg via BitTorrent from other players who have it. Falls back to HTTP direct download if no peers are available or if P2P is too slow.
4. **Seed:** Players who have downloaded a package automatically seed it to others (opt-out in settings). The more popular a resource, the faster it downloads — the opposite of CDN economics where popularity means higher cost.
5. **Verify:** SHA-256 checksum validation on the complete package, regardless of download method. BitTorrent's built-in piece-level hashing provides additional integrity during transfer.

**WebTorrent for browser builds (WASM):** Standard BitTorrent uses TCP/UDP, which browsers can't access. [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) extends the BitTorrent protocol over WebRTC, enabling browser-to-browser P2P. The Workshop server includes a WebTorrent tracker endpoint. Desktop clients and browser clients can interoperate — desktop seeds serve browser peers and vice versa through hybrid WebSocket/WebRTC bridges. **HTTP fallback is mandatory:** if WebTorrent signaling fails (signaling server down, WebRTC blocked), the client must fall back to direct HTTP download without user intervention. Multiple signaling servers are maintained for redundancy. Signaling servers only facilitate WebRTC negotiation — they never see package content, so even a compromised signaling server cannot serve tampered data (SHA-256 verification catches that).

**Tracker authentication & token rotation:** P2P tracker access uses per-session tokens tied to client authentication (Workshop credentials or anonymous session token), not static URL secrets. Tokens rotate every release cycle. Even unauthorized peers joining a swarm cannot serve corrupt data (SHA-256 + piece hashing), but token rotation limits unauthorized swarm observation and bandwidth waste. See `06-SECURITY.md` for the broader security model.

**Transport strategy by package size:**

| Package Size | Strategy                     | Rationale                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 5MB        | HTTP direct only             | P2P overhead exceeds benefit for small files. Maps, balance presets, palettes.              |
| 5–50MB       | P2P preferred, HTTP fallback | Small sprite packs, sound effect packs, script libraries. P2P helps but HTTP is acceptable. |
| > 50MB       | P2P strongly preferred       | HD resource packs, cutscene packs, full mods. P2P's cost advantage is decisive.             |

Thresholds are configurable in `settings.yaml`. Players on connections where BitTorrent is throttled or blocked can force HTTP-only mode.

**Auto-download on lobby join (D030 interaction):** When joining a lobby with missing resources, the client first attempts P2P download (likely fast, since other players in the lobby are already seeding). If the lobby timer is short or P2P is slow, falls back to HTTP. The lobby UI shows download progress with source indicators (P2P/HTTP). See D052 § "In-Lobby P2P Resource Sharing" for the detailed lobby protocol, including host-as-tracker, verification against Workshop index, and security constraints.

**Gaming industry precedent:**
- **Blizzard (WoW, StarCraft 2, Diablo 3):** Used a custom P2P downloader ("Blizzard Downloader", later integrated into Battle.net) for game patches and updates from 2004–2016. Saved millions in CDN costs for multi-GB patches distributed to millions of players.
- **Wargaming (World of Tanks):** Used P2P distribution for game updates.
- **Linux distributions:** Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch all offer torrent downloads for ISOs — the standard solution for distributing large files from community infrastructure.
- **Steam Workshop:** Steam subsidizes centralized hosting from game sales revenue. We don't have that luxury — P2P is the community-sustainable alternative.

**Competitive landscape — game mod platforms:**

IC's Workshop exists in a space with several established modding platforms. None offer the combination of P2P distribution, federation, self-hosting, and in-engine integration that IC targets.

| Platform                                                              | Model                                                                                                                       | Scale                                                                           | In-game integration                                                                            | P2P | Federation / Self-host | Dependencies | Open source                                          |

**Competitive landscape — P2P + Registry infrastructure:**

The game mod platforms above are all centralized. A separate set of projects tackle P2P distribution at the infrastructure level, but none target game modding specifically. See `research/p2p-federated-registry-analysis.md` for a comprehensive standalone analysis of this space and its applicability beyond IC.

| **[Uber Kraken](https://github.com/uber/kraken)** (6.6k★)                        | P2P Docker registry — custom BitTorrent-like protocol, Agent/Origin/Tracker/Build-Index. Pluggable storage (S3/GCS/HDFS).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Container images (datacenter)          | Closest architectural match. Kraken's Agent/Origin/Tracker/Build-Index maps to IC's Peer/Seed-box/Tracker/Workshop-Index. IC's P2P protocol design (peer selection policy, piece request strategy, connection state machine, announce cycle, bandwidth limiting) is directly informed by Kraken's production experience — see protocol details above and `research/p2p-federated-registry-analysis.md` § "Uber Kraken — Deep Dive" for the full analysis. Key difference: Kraken is intra-datacenter (3s announce, 10Gbps links), IC is internet-scale (30s announce, residential connections).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **[Dragonfly](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly)** (3k★, CNCF Graduated) | P2P content distribution — Manager/Scheduler/Seed-Peer/Peer. Centralized evaluator-based scheduling with 4-dimensional peer scoring (`LoadQuality×0.6 + IDCAffinity×0.2 + LocationAffinity×0.1 + HostType×0.1`). DAG-based peer graph, back-to-source fallback. Persistent cache with replica management. Client rewritten in Rust (v2). Trail of Bits audited (2023). | Container images, AI models, artifacts | Same P2P-with-fallback pattern. Dragonfly's hierarchical location affinity (`country\|province\|city\|zone`), statistical bad-peer detection (three-sigma rule), capacity-aware scoring, persistent replica count, and download priority tiers are all patterns IC adapts. Key differences: Dragonfly uses centralized scheduling (IC uses BitTorrent swarm — simpler, more resilient to churn), Dragonfly is single-cluster with no cross-cluster P2P (IC is federated), Dragonfly requires K8s+Redis+MySQL (IC requires only SQLite). Dragonfly's own RFC #3713 acknowledges piece-level selection is FCFS — BitTorrent's rarest-first is already better.

**What's novel about IC's combination:** No existing system — modding platform or infrastructure — combines (1) federated registry with repository types, (2) P2P distribution via BitTorrent/WebTorrent, (3) zero-infrastructure git-hosted bootstrap, (4) browser-compatible P2P via WebTorrent, (5) in-engine integration with lobby auto-download, and (6) fully open-source with self-hosting as a first-class use case. The closest architectural comparison is mod.io (embeddable SDK approach, in-game integration) but mod.io is a proprietary centralized SaaS — no P2P, no federation, no self-hosting. The closest distribution comparison is Uber Kraken (P2P registry) but it has no modding features. Each piece has strong precedent; the combination is new. The Workshop architecture is game-agnostic and could serve as a standalone platform — see the research analysis for exploration of this possibility.

**Seeding infrastructure:**

The Workshop doesn't rely solely on player altruism for seeding:

- **Workshop seed server:** A dedicated seed box (modest: a VPS with good upload bandwidth) that permanently seeds all Workshop content. This ensures new/unpopular packages are always downloadable even with zero player peers. Cost: ~$20-50/month for a VPS with 1TB+ storage and unmetered bandwidth.
- **Community seed volunteers:** Players who opt in to extended seeding (beyond just while the game is running). Similar to how Linux mirror operators volunteer bandwidth. Could be incentivized with Workshop badges/reputation (D036/D037).
- **Mirror servers (federation):** Community-hosted Workshop servers (D030 federation) also seed the content they host. Regional community servers naturally become regional seeds.
- **Lobby-optimized seeding:** When a lobby host has required mods, the game client prioritizes seeding to joining players who are downloading. The "auto-download on lobby join" flow becomes: download from lobby peers first → swarm → HTTP fallback.

**Privacy and security:**

- **IP visibility:** Standard BitTorrent exposes peer IP addresses. This is the same exposure as any multiplayer game (players already see each other's IPs or relay IPs). For privacy-sensitive users, HTTP-only mode avoids P2P IP exposure.
- **Content integrity:** SHA-256 verification on complete packages catches any tampering. BitTorrent's piece-level hashing catches corruption during transfer. Double-verified.
- **No metadata leakage:** The tracker only knows which peers have which packages (by info hash). It doesn't inspect content. Package contents are just game assets — sprites, audio, maps.
- **ISP throttling mitigation:** BitTorrent traffic can be throttled by ISPs. Mitigations: protocol encryption (standard in modern BT clients), WebSocket transport (looks like web traffic), and HTTP fallback as ultimate escape. Settings allow forcing HTTP-only mode.
- **Resource exhaustion:** Rate-limited seeding (configurable upload cap in settings). Players control how much bandwidth they donate. Default: 1MB/s upload, adjustable to 0 (leech-only, no seeding — discouraged but available).

**P2P protocol design details:**

The Workshop's P2P engine is informed by production experience from Uber Kraken (Apache 2.0, 6.6k★) and Dragonfly (Apache 2.0, CNCF Graduated). Kraken distributes 1M+ container images/day across 15K+ hosts using a custom BitTorrent-inspired protocol; Dragonfly uses centralized evaluator-based scheduling at Alibaba scale. IC adapts Kraken's connection management and Dragonfly's scoring insights for internet-scale game mod distribution. See `research/p2p-federated-registry-analysis.md` for full architectural analyses of both systems.

> **Cross-pollination with IC netcode and community infrastructure.** The Workshop P2P engine and IC's netcode infrastructure (relay server, tracking server — `03-NETCODE.md`) share deep structural parallels: federation, heartbeat/TTL, rate control, connection state machines, observability, deployment model. Patterns flow both directions — netcode's three-layer rate control and token-based liveness improve Workshop; Workshop's EWMA scoring and multi-dimensional peer evaluation improve relay server quality tracking. A full cross-pollination analysis (including shared infrastructure opportunities: unified server binary, federation library, auth/identity layer) is in `research/p2p-federated-registry-analysis.md` § "Netcode ↔ Workshop Cross-Pollination." Additional cross-pollination with D052/D053 (community servers, player profiles, trust-based filtering) is catalogued in D052 § "Cross-Pollination" — highlights include: two-key architecture for index signing and publisher identity, trust-based source filtering, server-side validation as a shared invariant, and trust-verified peer selection scoring.

*Peer selection policy (tracker-side):* The tracker returns a sorted peer list on each announce response. The sorting policy is **pluggable** — inspired by Kraken's `assignmentPolicy` interface pattern. IC's default policy prioritizes:

1. **Seeders** (completed packages — highest priority, like Kraken's `completeness` policy)
2. **Lobby peers** (peers in the same multiplayer lobby — guaranteed to have the content, lowest latency)
3. **Geographically close peers** (same region/ASN — reduces cross-continent transfers)
4. **High-completion peers** (more pieces available — better utilization of each connection)
5. **Random** (fallback for ties — prevents herding)

Peer handout limit: 30 peers per announce response (Kraken uses 50, but IC has fewer total peers per package). Community-hosted trackers can implement custom policies via the server config.

*Planned evolution — weighted multi-dimensional scoring (Phase 5+):* Dragonfly's evaluator demonstrates that combining capacity, locality, and node type into a weighted score produces better peer selection than linear priority tiers. IC's Phase 5+ peer selection evolves to a weighted scoring model informed by Dragonfly's approach:

```
PeerScore = Capacity(0.4) + Locality(0.3) + SeedStatus(0.2) + LobbyContext(0.1)
```

- **Capacity (weight 0.4):** Spare bandwidth reported in announce (`1 - upload_bw_used / upload_bw_max`). Peers with more headroom score higher. Inspired by Dragonfly's `LoadQuality` metric (which sub-decomposes into peak bandwidth, sustained load, and concurrency). IC uses a single utilization ratio — simpler, captures the same core insight.
- **Locality (weight 0.3):** Hierarchical location matching. Clients self-report location as `continent|country|region|city` (4-level, pipe-delimited — adapted from Dragonfly's 5-level `country|province|city|zone|cluster`). Score = `matched_prefix_elements / 4`. Two peers in the same city score 0.75; same country but different region: 0.5; same continent: 0.25.
- **SeedStatus (weight 0.2):** Seed box = 1.0, completed seeder = 0.7, uploading leecher = 0.3. Inspired by Dragonfly's `HostType` score (seed peers = 1.0, normal = 0.5).
- **LobbyContext (weight 0.1):** Same lobby = 1.0, same game session = 0.5, no context = 0. IC-specific — Dragonfly has no equivalent (no lobby concept).

The initial 5-tier priority system (above) ships first and is adequate for community scale. Weighted scoring is additive — the same pluggable policy interface supports both approaches. Community servers can configure their own weights or contribute custom scoring policies.

*Piece request strategy (client-side):* The engine uses **rarest-first** piece selection by default — a priority queue sorted by fewest peers having each piece. This is standard BitTorrent behavior, well-validated for internet conditions. Kraken also implements this as `rarestFirstPolicy`.

- **Pipeline limit:** 3 concurrent piece requests per peer (matches Kraken's default). Prevents overwhelming slow peers.
- **Piece request timeout:** 8s base + 6s per MB of piece size (more generous than Kraken's 4s+4s/MB, compensating for residential internet variance).
- **Endgame mode:** When remaining pieces ≤ 5, the engine sends duplicate piece requests to multiple peers. This prevents the "last piece stall" — a well-known BitTorrent problem where the final piece's sole holder is slow. Kraken implements this as `EndgameThreshold` — it's essential.

*Connection state machine (client-side):*

```
pending ──connect──► active ──timeout/error──► blacklisted
   ▲                    │                          │
   │                    │                          │
   └──────────── cooldown (5min) ◄─────────────────┘
```

- `MaxConnectionsPerPackage: 8` (lower than Kraken's 10 — residential connections have less bandwidth to share)
- Blacklisting: peers that produce zero useful throughput over 30 seconds are temporarily blacklisted (5-minute cooldown). Catches both dead peers and ISP-throttled connections.
- *Sybil resistance:* Maximum 3 peers per /24 subnet in a single swarm. Prefer peers from diverse autonomous systems (ASNs) when possible. Sybil attacks can waste bandwidth but cannot serve corrupt data (SHA-256 integrity), so the risk ceiling is low.
- *Statistical degradation detection (Phase 5+):* Inspired by Dragonfly's `IsBadParent` algorithm — track per-peer piece transfer times. Peers whose last transfer exceeds `max(3 × mean, 2 × p95)` of observed transfer times are demoted in scoring (not hard-blacklisted — they may recover). For sparse data (< 50 samples per peer), fall back to the simpler "20× mean" ratio check. Hard blacklist remains only for zero-throughput (complete failure). This catches degrading peers before they fail completely.
- Connections have TTL — idle connections are closed after 60 seconds to free resources.

*Announce cycle (client → tracker):* Clients announce to the tracker every **30 seconds** (Kraken uses 3s for datacenter — far too aggressive for internet). The tracker can dynamically adjust: faster intervals (10s) during active downloads, slower (60s) when seeding idle content. Max interval cap (120s) prevents unbounded growth. Announce payload includes: PeerID, package info hash, bitfield (what pieces the client has), upload/download speed.

*Size-based piece length:* Different package sizes use different piece lengths to balance metadata overhead against download granularity (inspired by Kraken's `PieceLengths` config):

| Package Size | Piece Length    | Rationale                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 5MB        | N/A — HTTP only | P2P overhead exceeds benefit                                  |
| 5–50MB       | 256KB           | Fine-grained. Good for partial recovery and slow connections. |
| 50–500MB     | 1MB             | Balanced. Reasonable metadata overhead.                       |
| > 500MB      | 4MB             | Reduced metadata overhead for large packages.                 |

*Bandwidth limiting:* Configurable per-client in `settings.yaml`. Residential users cannot have their connection saturated by mod seeding — this is a hard requirement that Kraken solves with `egress_bits_per_sec`/`ingress_bits_per_sec` and IC must match.

```yaml
# settings.yaml — P2P bandwidth configuration
workshop:
  p2p:
    max_upload_speed: "1 MB/s"       # Default. 0 = unlimited, "0 B/s" = no seeding
    max_download_speed: "unlimited"   # Default. Most users won't limit.
    seed_after_download: true         # Keep seeding while game is running
    seed_duration_after_exit: "30m"   # Background seeding after game closes (0 = none)
    cache_size_limit: "2 GB"          # LRU eviction when exceeded
    prefer_p2p: true                  # false = always use HTTP direct
```

*Health checks:* Seed boxes implement heartbeat health checks (30s interval, 3 failures → unhealthy, 2 passes → healthy again — matching Kraken's active health check parameters). The tracker marks peers as offline after 2× announce interval without contact. Unhealthy seed boxes are removed from the announce response until they recover.

*Content lifecycle:* Downloaded packages stay in the seeding pool for 30 minutes after the game exits (configurable via `seed_duration_after_exit`). This is longer than Kraken's 5-minute `seeder_tti` because IC has fewer peers per package — each seeder is more valuable. Disk cache uses LRU eviction when over `cache_size_limit`. Packages currently in use or being seeded are never evicted.

*Download priority tiers:* Inspired by Dragonfly's 7-level priority system (Level0–Level6), IC uses 3 priority tiers to enable QoS differentiation. Higher-priority downloads preempt lower-priority ones (pause background downloads, reallocate bandwidth and connection slots):

| Priority | Name             | When Used                                                | Behavior                                                   |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 (high) | `lobby-urgent`   | Player joining a lobby that requires missing mods        | Preempts all other downloads. Uses all available bandwidth |
| 2 (mid)  | `user-requested` | Player manually downloads from Workshop browser          | Normal bandwidth. Runs alongside background.               |
| 3 (low)  | `background`     | Cache warming, auto-updates, subscribed mod pre-download | Bandwidth-limited. Paused when higher-priority active.     |

*Preheat / prefetch:* Adapted from Dragonfly's preheat jobs (which pre-warm content on seed peers before demand). IC uses two prefetch patterns:

- **Lobby prefetch:** When a lobby host sets required mods, the Workshop server (Phase 5+) can pre-seed those mods to seed boxes before players join. The lobby creation event is the prefetch signal. This ensures seed infrastructure is warm when players start downloading.
- **Subscription prefetch:** Players can subscribe to Workshop publishers or resources. Subscribed content auto-downloads in the background at `background` priority. When a subscribed mod updates, the new version downloads automatically before the player next launches the game.

*Persistent replica count (Phase 5+):* Inspired by Dragonfly's `PersistentReplicaCount`, the Workshop server tracks how many seed boxes hold each resource. If the count drops below a configurable threshold (default: 2 for popular resources, 1 for all others), the server triggers automatic re-seeding from HTTP origin. This ensures the "always available" guarantee — even if all player peers are offline, seed infrastructure maintains minimum replica coverage.

**Early-phase bootstrap — Git-hosted package index:**

Before the full Workshop server is built (Phase 4-5), a **GitHub-hosted package index repository** serves as the Workshop's discovery and coordination layer. This is a well-proven pattern — Homebrew (`homebrew-core`), Rust (`crates.io-index`), Winget (`winget-pkgs`), and Nixpkgs all use a git repository as their canonical package index.

**How it works:**

A public GitHub repository (e.g., `iron-curtain/workshop-index`) contains YAML manifest files — one per package — that describe available resources, their versions, checksums, download locations, and dependencies. The repo itself contains NO asset files — only lightweight metadata.

```

**`sources.yaml` — storage server and tracker registry:**

```yaml

# The engine reads this to discover available download sources.
# Adding an official server later = adding a line here.
storage_servers:
  - url: "https://github.com/iron-curtain/workshop-packages/releases"  # GitHub Releases (Phase 0-3)
    type: github-releases
    priority: 1
  # - url: "https://cdn.ironcurtain.gg"   # Future: official CDN (Phase 5+)
  #   type: http
  #   priority: 1

  - "udp://tracker.ironcurtain.gg:6969/announce"  # UDP (desktop only)

seed_boxes:
  - "https://seed1.ironcurtain.gg"  # Permanent seeder for all packages
```

**Two client access patterns:**

1. **HTTP fetch** (game client default): The engine fetches `index.yaml` via `raw.githubusercontent.com` — a single GET request returns the full package listing. Fast, no git dependency, CDN-backed globally by GitHub. Cached locally with ETag/Last-Modified for incremental updates.
2. **Git clone/pull** (SDK, power users, offline): `git clone` the entire index repo. `git pull` for incremental atomic updates. Full offline browsing. Better for the SDK/editor and users who want to script against the index.

The engine's Workshop source configuration (D030) treats this as a new source type:

```yaml
# settings.yaml — Phase 0-3 configuration
workshop:
  sources:
    - url: "https://github.com/iron-curtain/workshop-index"  # git-index source
      type: git-index
      priority: 1
    - path: "C:/my-local-workshop"   # local development
      type: local
      priority: 2
```

**Community contribution workflow (manual):**

1. Modder creates a `.icpkg` package and uploads it to GitHub Releases (or any HTTP host)
2. Modder submits a PR to `workshop-index` adding a manifest YAML with SHA-256 and download URL
3. GitHub Actions validates manifest format, checks SHA-256 against the download URL, verifies metadata
4. Maintainers review and merge → package is discoverable to all players on next index fetch
5. When the full Workshop server ships (Phase 4-5), published packages migrate automatically — the manifest format is the same

**Git-index security hardening** (see `06-SECURITY.md` § Vulnerabilities 20–21 and `research/workshop-registry-vulnerability-analysis.md` for full threat analysis):

- **Path-scoped PR validation:** CI rejects PRs that modify files outside the submitter's package directory. A PR adding `packages/alice/tanks/1.0.0.yaml` may ONLY modify files under `packages/alice/`. Modification of other paths → automatic CI failure.
- **CODEOWNERS:** Maps `packages/alice/** @alice-github`. GitHub enforces that only the package owner can approve changes to their manifests.
- **`manifest_hash` verification:** CI downloads the `.icpkg`, extracts `manifest.yaml`, computes its SHA-256, and verifies it matches the `manifest_hash` field in the index entry. Prevents manifest confusion (registry entry diverging from package contents).
- **Consolidated `index.yaml` is CI-generated:** Deterministically rebuilt from per-package manifests — never hand-edited. Any contributor can reproduce locally to verify integrity.
- **Index signing (Phase 3–4):** CI signs the consolidated `index.yaml` with an Ed25519 key stored outside GitHub. Clients verify the signature. Repository compromise without the signing key produces unsigned (rejected) indexes. Uses the **two-key architecture** from D052 (§ Key Lifecycle): the CI-held key is the Signing Key (SK); a Recovery Key (RK), held offline by ≥2 maintainers, enables key rotation on compromise without breaking client trust chains. See D052 § "Cross-Pollination" for the full rationale.
- **Actions pinned to commit SHAs:** All GitHub Actions referenced by SHA, not by mutable tag. Minimal `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions. No secrets in the PR validation pipeline.
- **Branch protection on main:** Require signed commits, no force-push, require PR reviews, no single-person merge. Repository must have ≥3 maintainers.

**Automated publish via `ic` CLI (same UX as Phase 5+):**

The `ic mod publish` command works against the git-index backend in Phase 0–3:

1. `ic mod publish` packages content into `.icpkg`, computes SHA-256
2. Uploads `.icpkg` to GitHub Releases (via GitHub API, using a personal access token configured in `ic auth`)
3. Generates the index manifest YAML from `mod.yaml` metadata
4. Opens a PR to `workshop-index` with the manifest file
5. Modder reviews the PR and confirms; GitHub Actions validates; maintainers merge

The command is identical to Phase 5+ publishing (`ic mod publish`) — the only difference is the backend. When the Workshop server ships, `ic mod publish` targets the server instead. Modders don't change their workflow.

**Adding official storage servers later:**

When official infrastructure is ready (Phase 5+), adding it is a one-line change to `sources.yaml` — no architecture change, no client update. The `sources.yaml` in the index repo is the single place that lists where packages can be downloaded from. Community mirrors and CDN endpoints are added the same way.

**Phased progression:**

1. **Phase 0–3 — Git-hosted index + GitHub Releases:** The index repo is the Workshop. Players fetch `index.yaml` for discovery, download `.icpkg` files from GitHub Releases (2GB per file, free, CDN-backed). Community contributes via PR. Zero custom server code. Zero hosting cost.
2. **Phase 3–4 — Add BitTorrent tracker:** A minimal tracker binary goes live ($5-10/month VPS). Package manifests gain `torrent` source entries. P2P delivery begins for large packages. The index repo remains the discovery layer.
3. **Phase 4–5 — Full Workshop server:** Search, ratings, dependency resolution, FTS5, integrated P2P tracker. The Workshop server can either replace the git index or coexist alongside it (both are valid D030 sources). The git index remains available as a fallback and for community-hosted Workshop servers.

The progression is smooth because the federated source model (D030) already supports multiple source types — `git-index`, `local`, `remote` (Workshop server), and `steam` all coexist in `settings.yaml`.

**Industry precedent:**

| Project                                | Index Mechanism                                          | Scale          |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Homebrew** (`homebrew-core`)         | Git repo of Ruby formulae; `brew update` = `git pull`    | ~7K packages   |
| **Rust crates.io** (`crates.io-index`) | Git repo of JSON metadata; sparse HTTP fetch added later | ~150K crates   |
| **Winget** (`winget-pkgs`)             | Git repo of YAML manifests; community PRs                | ~5K packages   |
| **Nixpkgs**                            | Git repo of Nix expressions                              | ~100K packages |
| **Scoop** (Windows)                    | Git repo ("buckets") of JSON manifests                   | ~5K packages   |

All of these started with git-as-index and some (crates.io) later augmented with sparse HTTP fetching for performance at scale. The same progression applies here — git index works perfectly for a community of hundreds to low thousands, and can be complemented (not replaced) by a Workshop API when scale demands it.

**Workshop server architecture with P2P:**

```

All three components (metadata, tracker, HTTP fallback) run in the same binary — "just a Rust binary" deployment philosophy. Community self-hosters get the full stack with one executable.

### Rust Implementation

**BitTorrent client library:** The `ic` CLI and game client embed a BitTorrent client. Rust options:
- [`librqbit`](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit) — pure Rust, async (tokio), actively maintained, supports WebTorrent
- [`cratetorrent`](https://github.com/mandreyel/cratetorrent) — pure Rust, educational focus
- Custom minimal client — only needs download + seed + tracker announce; no DHT, no PEX needed for a controlled Workshop ecosystem

**BitTorrent tracker:** Embeddable in the Workshop server binary. Rust options:
- [`aquatic`](https://github.com/greatest-ape/aquatic) — high-performance Rust tracker
- Custom minimal tracker — HTTP announce/scrape endpoints, peer list management. The Workshop server already has SQLite; peer lists are another table.

**WebTorrent:** `librqbit` has WebTorrent support. The WASM build would use the WebRTC transport.

### Rationale

- **Cost sustainability:** P2P reduces Workshop hosting costs by 90%+. A community project cannot afford CDN bills that scale with popularity. A tracker + seed box for $30-50/month serves unlimited download volume.
- **Fits federation (D030):** P2P is another source in the federated model. The virtual repository queries metadata from remote servers, then downloads content from the swarm — same user experience, different transport.
- **Fits "no single point of failure" (D037):** P2P is inherently resilient. If the Workshop server goes down, peers keep sharing. Content already downloaded is always available.
- **Fits SHA-256 integrity (D030):** P2P needs exactly the integrity verification already designed. Same `manifest.yaml` checksums, same `ic.lock` pinning, same verification on install.
- **Fits WASM target (invariant #10):** WebTorrent enables browser-to-browser P2P. Desktop and browser clients interoperate. No second-class platform.
- **Popular resources get faster:** More downloads → more seeders → faster downloads for everyone. The opposite of CDN economics where popularity increases cost.
- **Self-hosting scales:** Community Workshop servers (D030 federation) benefit from the same P2P economics. A small community server needs only a $5 VPS — the community's players provide the bandwidth.
- **Privacy-responsible:** IP exposure is equivalent to any multiplayer game. HTTP-only mode available for privacy-sensitive users. No additional surveillance beyond standard BitTorrent protocol.
- **Proven technology:** BitTorrent has been distributing large files reliably for 20+ years. Blizzard used it for WoW patches. The protocol is well-understood, well-documented, and well-implemented.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Centralized CDN only** (rejected — financially unsustainable for a donation-funded community project. A popular 500MB mod downloaded 10K times = 5TB = $50-450/month. P2P reduces this to near-zero marginal cost)
- **IPFS** (rejected as primary distribution protocol — slow cold-content discovery, complex setup, ecosystem declining, content pinning is expensive, poor game-quality UX. However, multiple Bitswap protocol design patterns adopted: EWMA peer scoring, per-peer fairness caps, want-have/want-block two-phase discovery, broadcast control, dual WAN/LAN discovery, delegated HTTP routing, batch provider announcements. See competitive landscape table above and research deep dive)
- **Custom P2P protocol** (rejected — massive engineering effort with no advantage over BitTorrent's 20-year-proven protocol)
- **Git LFS** (rejected — 1GB free then paid; designed for source code, not binary asset distribution; no P2P)
- **Steam Workshop only** (rejected — platform lock-in, Steam subsidizes hosting from game sales revenue we don't have, excludes non-Steam/WASM builds)
- **GitHub Releases only** (rejected — works for bootstrap but no search, ratings, dependency resolution, P2P, or lobby auto-download. Adequate interim solution, not long-term architecture)
- **HTTP-only with community mirrors** (rejected — still fragile. Mirrors are one operator away from going offline. P2P is inherently more resilient than any number of mirrors)
- **No git index / custom server from day one** (rejected — premature complexity. A git-hosted index costs $0 and ships with the first playable build. Custom server code can wait until Phase 4-5 when the community is large enough to need search/ratings)

### Phase

- **Phase 0–3:** Git-hosted package index (`workshop-index` repo) + GitHub Releases for `.icpkg` storage. Zero infrastructure cost. Community contributes via PR. Game client fetches `index.yaml` for discovery.
- **Phase 3–4:** Add BitTorrent tracker ($5-10/month VPS). Package manifests gain `torrent` source entries. P2P delivery begins for large packages. Git index remains the discovery layer.
- **Phase 4–5:** Full Workshop server with integrated BitTorrent/WebTorrent tracker, search, ratings, dependency resolution, P2P delivery, HTTP fallback via S3-compatible storage. Git index can coexist or be subsumed.
- **Phase 6a:** Federation (community servers join the P2P swarm), Steam Workshop as additional source, Publisher workflows
- **Format recommendations** apply from Phase 0 — all first-party content uses the recommended canonical formats

## D050: Workshop as Cross-Project Reusable Library

**Decision:** The Workshop core (registry, distribution, federation, P2P) is designed as a **standalone, engine-agnostic, game-agnostic Rust library** that Iron Curtain is the first consumer of, with the explicit intent that future game projects (XCOM-inspired tactics clone, Civilization-inspired 4X clone, Operation Flashpoint/ArmA-inspired military sim) will be additional consumers. These future projects may or may not use Bevy — the Workshop library must not depend on any specific game engine.

**Rationale:**
- The author plans to build multiple open-source game clones in the spirit of OpenRA, each targeting a different genre's community. Every one of these projects faces the same Workshop problem: mod distribution, versioning, dependencies, integrity, community hosting, P2P delivery
- Building Workshop infrastructure once and reusing it across projects amortizes the significant design and engineering investment over multiple games
- An XCOM clone needs soldier mods, ability packs, map presets, voice packs. A Civ clone needs civilization packs, map scripts, leader art, scenario bundles. An OFP/ArmA clone needs terrains (often 5–20 GB), vehicle models, weapon packs, mission scripts, campaign packages. All of these are "versioned packages with metadata, dependencies, and integrity verification" — the same core abstraction
- The P2P distribution layer is especially valuable for the ArmA-style project where mod sizes routinely exceed what any free CDN can sustain
- Making the library engine-agnostic also produces cleaner IC code — the Bevy integration layer is thinner, better tested, and easier to maintain

### Two-Layer Architecture

The Workshop is split into two layers with a clean boundary:

### Impact on Existing D030/D049 Design

The existing Workshop design requires only **architectural clarification**, not redesign. The core abstractions (packages, manifests, publishers, dependencies, federation, P2P) are already game-agnostic in concept. The changes are:

1. **Naming**: Where the design says `.icpkg`, the implementation will have a configurable extension with `.icpkg` as IC's default. Where it says `ic mod *`, the core library provides operations and IC wraps them as `ic mod *` subcommands.

2. **Categories**: Where D030 lists a fixed `ResourceCategory` enum (Music, Sprites, Maps...), the core library uses free-form tags. IC's integration layer provides a recommended tag vocabulary and UI groupings. Other projects provide their own.

3. **Manifest**: The `manifest.yaml` schema splits into core fields (in the library) and extension fields (per-project). `game_module: ra1` is an IC extension field, not a core manifest requirement.

4. **Format recommendations**: D049's Bevy-native format table is IC-specific guidance, not a core Workshop concern. The core library is format-agnostic. Each consuming project publishes its own format recommendations based on its engine's capabilities.

5. **P2P scoring**: The `LobbyContext` dimension in peer scoring becomes `ApplicationContext` — a generic callback where any project can inject context-aware peer prioritization. IC implements it as "same lobby = bonus." An ArmA-style project implements it as "same server = bonus."

6. **Infrastructure**: Domain names (`ironcurtain.gg`), GitHub org (`iron-curtain/`), tracker URLs — these are IC deployment configuration. The core library is configured via `sources.yaml` with no hardcoded URLs.

### Cross-Project Infrastructure Sharing

While each project has its own Workshop deployment, sharing is possible:

- **Shared tracker**: A single BitTorrent tracker can serve multiple game projects. The info-hash namespace is naturally disjoint (different packages = different hashes).
- **Shared git-index hosting**: One GitHub org could host workshop-index repos for multiple projects.
- **Shared seed boxes**: Seed infrastructure can serve packages from multiple games simultaneously — BitTorrent doesn't care about content semantics.
- **Cross-project dependencies**: A music pack or shader effect could be published once and depended on by packages from multiple games. The identity system (`publisher/name@version`) is globally unique.
- **Shared federation network**: Community-hosted Workshop servers could participate in multiple games' federation networks simultaneously.

> **Also shared with IC's netcode infrastructure.** The tracking server, relay server, and Workshop server share deep structural parallels within IC itself — federation, heartbeats, rate control, connection management, observability, deployment principles. The cross-pollination analysis (`research/p2p-federated-registry-analysis.md` § "Netcode ↔ Workshop Cross-Pollination") identifies four shared infrastructure opportunities: a unified `ic-server` binary (tracking + relay + workshop in one process for small community operators), a shared federation library (multi-source aggregation used by both tracking and Workshop), a shared auth/identity layer (one Ed25519 keypair for multiplayer + publishing + profile), and shared scoring infrastructure (EWMA time-decaying reputation used by both P2P peer scoring and relay player quality tracking). The federation library and scoring infrastructure belong in the Workshop core library (D050) since they're already game-agnostic.

### Engine-Agnostic P2P and Netcode

The P2P distribution protocol (BitTorrent/WebTorrent) and all the patterns adopted from Kraken, Dragonfly, and IPFS (see D049 competitive landscape and `research/p2p-federated-registry-analysis.md`) are **already engine-agnostic**. The protocol operates at the TCP/UDP level — it doesn't know or care whether the consuming application uses Bevy, Godot, Unreal, or a custom engine. The Rust implementation (`ic-workshop` core library) has no engine dependency.

For projects that use a non-Rust engine (unlikely given the author's preferences, but architecturally supported): the Workshop core library exposes a C FFI or can be compiled as a standalone process that the game communicates with via IPC/localhost HTTP. The CLI itself serves as a non-Rust integration path — any game engine can shell out to the Workshop CLI for install/update operations.

### Non-RTS Game Considerations

Each future genre introduces patterns the current design doesn't explicitly address:

| Genre                         | Key Workshop Differences                                                                                            | Already Handled                                                               | Needs Attention                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Turn-based tactics** (XCOM) | Smaller mod sizes, more code-heavy mods (abilities, AI), procedural map parameters                                  | Package format, dependencies, P2P                                             | Ability/behavior mods may need a scripting sandbox equivalent to IC's Lua/WASM — but that's a game concern, not a Workshop concern                                                                                                                |
| **Turn-based 4X** (Civ)       | Very large mod variety (civilizations, maps, scenarios, art), DLC-like mod structure, long-lived save compatibility | Package format, dependencies, versioning, P2P                                 | Save-game compatibility metadata (a Civ mod that changes game rules may break existing saves). Workshop manifest could include `breaks_saves: true` as an extension field                                                                         |
| **Military sim** (OFP/ArmA)   | Very large packages (terrains 5–20 GB), server-mandated mod lists, many simultaneous mods active                    | P2P (critical for large packages), dependencies, auto-download on server join | Partial downloads (download terrain mesh now, HD textures later) could benefit from sub-package granularity. Workshop packages already support dependencies — a terrain could be split into `base` + `hd-textures` + `satellite-imagery` packages |
| **Any**                       | Different scripting languages, different asset formats, different mod structures                                    | Core library is content-agnostic                                              | Nothing — this is the point of the two-layer design                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Phase

D050 is an architectural principle, not a deliverable with its own phase. It shapes HOW D030 and D049 are implemented:

- **IC Phase 3–4**: Implement Workshop core as a separate Rust library crate within the IC monorepo. The crate has zero Bevy dependencies. IC's Bevy plugin wraps the core library. The API boundary enforces the two-layer split from the start.
- **IC Phase 5–6**: If a second game project begins, the core library can be extracted to its own repo with minimal effort because the boundary was enforced from day one.
- **Post-IC-launch**: Each new game project creates its own integration layer and deployment configuration. The core library, P2P protocol, and federation specification are shared.

### P003 — Audio System Design Notes

The audio system is the least-designed critical subsystem. Beyond the library choice, Phase 3 needs to resolve:

- **Original `.aud` playback and encoding:** Decoding and encoding Westwood's `.aud` format (IMA ADPCM, mono/stereo, 8/16-bit, varying sample rates). Full codec implementation based on EA GPL source — `AUDHeaderType` header, `IndexTable`/`DiffTable` lookup tables, 4-bit nibble processing. See `05-FORMATS.md` § AUD Audio Format for complete struct definitions and algorithm details. Encoding support enables the Asset Studio (D040) audio converter for .aud ↔ .wav/.ogg conversion
- **Music loading from Remastered Collection:** If the player owns the Remastered Collection, can IC load the remastered soundtrack? Licensing allows personal use of purchased files, but the integration path needs design
- **Dynamic music states:** Combat/build/idle transitions (original RA had this — "Act on Instinct" during combat, ambient during base building). State machine driven by sim events
- **Music as Workshop resources:** Swappable soundtrack packs via D030 — architecture supports this, but audio pipeline needs to be resource-pack-aware
- **Frank Klepacki’s music is integral to C&C identity.** The audio system should treat music as a first-class system, not an afterthought. See `13-PHILOSOPHY.md` § "Audio Drives Tempo"

### P006 — RESOLVED: See D051

## D051: Engine License — GPL v3 with Explicit Modding Exception

**Decision:** The Iron Curtain engine is licensed under **GNU General Public License v3.0** (GPL v3) with an explicit **modding exception** that clarifies mods loaded through the engine's data and scripting interfaces are NOT derivative works.

**Rationale:**

1. **The C&C open-source community is a GPL community.** EA released every C&C source code drop under GPL v3 — Red Alert, Tiberian Dawn, Generals/Zero Hour, and the Remastered Collection engine. OpenRA uses GPL v3. Stratagus uses GPL-2.0. Spring Engine uses GPL-2.0. The community this project is built for lives in GPL-land. GPL v3 is the license they know, trust, and expect.

2. **Legal compatibility with EA source.** `ra-formats` directly references EA's GPL v3 source code for struct definitions, compression algorithms, and lookup tables (see `05-FORMATS.md` § Binary Format Codec Reference). GPL v3 for the engine is the cleanest legal path — no license compatibility analysis required.

3. **The engine stays open — forever.** GPL guarantees that no one can fork the engine, close-source it, and compete with the community's own project. For a community that has watched proprietary decisions kill or fragment C&C projects over three decades, this guarantee matters. MIT/Apache would allow exactly the kind of proprietary fork the community fears.

4. **Contributor alignment.** DCO + GPL v3 is the combination used by the Linux kernel — the most successful community-developed project in history. OpenRA contributors moving to IC (or contributing to both) face zero license friction.

5. **Modders are NOT restricted.** This is the key concern the old tension analysis raised, and the answer is clear: YAML data files, Lua scripts, and WASM modules loaded through a sandboxed runtime interface are NOT derivative works under GPL. This is the same settled legal interpretation as:
   - Linux kernel (GPL) + userspace programs (any license)
   - Blender (GPL) + Python scripts (any license)
   - WordPress (GPL) + themes and plugins loaded via defined APIs
   - GCC (GPL) + programs compiled by GCC (any license, via runtime library exception)
   
   IC's tiered modding architecture (D003/D004/D005) was specifically designed so that mods operate through data interfaces and sandboxed runtimes, never linking against engine code. The modding exception makes this explicit.

6. **Commercial use is allowed.** GPL v3 permits selling copies, hosting commercial servers, running tournaments with prize pools, and charging for relay hosting. It requires sharing source modifications — which is exactly what this community wants.

**The modding exception (added to LICENSE header):**

```
Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7:

If you modify this Program or any covered work, by linking or combining
it with content loaded through the engine's data interfaces (YAML rule
files, Lua scripts, WASM modules, resource packs, Workshop packages, or
any content loaded through the modding tiers described in the
documentation as "Tier 1", "Tier 2", or "Tier 3"), the content loaded
through those interfaces is NOT considered part of the covered work and
is NOT subject to the terms of this License. Authors of such content may
choose any license they wish.

This exception does not affect the copyleft requirement for modifications
to the engine source code itself.
```

This exception uses GPL v3 § 7's "additional permissions" mechanism — the same mechanism GCC uses for its runtime library exception. It is legally sound and well-precedented.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **MIT / Apache 2.0** (rejected — allows proprietary forks that fragment the community; creates legal ambiguity when referencing GPL'd EA source code; the Bevy ecosystem uses MIT/Apache but Bevy is a general-purpose framework, not a community-specific game engine)
- **LGPL** (rejected — complex, poorly understood by non-lawyers, and unnecessary given the explicit modding exception under GPL v3 § 7)
- **Dual license (GPL + commercial)** (rejected — adds complexity with no clear benefit; GPL v3 already permits commercial use)
- **GPL v3 without modding exception** (rejected — would leave legal ambiguity about WASM mods that might be interpreted as derivative works; the explicit exception removes all doubt)

**What this means in practice:**

| Activity                                    | Allowed? | Requirement                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Play the game                               | Yes      | —                                                        |
| Create YAML/Lua/WASM mods                   | Yes      | Any license you want (modding exception)                 |
| Publish mods on Workshop                    | Yes      | Author chooses license (D030 requires SPDX declaration)  |
| Sell a total conversion mod                 | Yes      | Mod's license is the author's choice                     |
| Fork the engine                             | Yes      | Your fork must also be GPL v3                            |
| Run a commercial server                     | Yes      | If you modify the server code, share those modifications |
| Use IC code in a proprietary game           | No       | Engine modifications must be GPL v3                      |
| Embed IC engine in a closed-source launcher | Yes      | The engine remains GPL v3; the launcher is separate      |

### Phase

Resolved. The LICENSE file ships with the GPL v3 text plus the modding exception header from Phase 0 onward.

### CI Enforcement: cargo-deny for License Compliance

Embark Studios' **cargo-deny** (2,204★, MIT/Apache-2.0) automates license compatibility checking across the entire dependency tree. IC should add `cargo-deny` to CI from Phase 0 with a GPL v3 compatibility allowlist — every `cargo deny check licenses` run verifies that no dependency introduces a license incompatible with GPL v3 (e.g., SSPL, proprietary, GPL-2.0-only without "or later"). For Workshop content (D030), the `spdx` crate (also from Embark, 140★) parses SPDX license expressions from resource manifests, enabling automated compatibility checks at publish time. See `research/embark-studios-rust-gamedev-analysis.md` § cargo-deny.

## D052: Community Servers with Portable Signed Credentials

**Decision:** Multiplayer ranking, matchmaking, and competitive history are managed through **Community Servers** — self-hostable services that federate like Workshop sources (D030/D050). Player skill data is stored **locally** in a per-community SQLite credential file, with each record individually signed by the community server using Ed25519. The player presents the credential file when joining games; the server verifies its signature without needing to look up a central database. This is architecturally equivalent to JWT-style portable tokens, but uses a purpose-built binary format (**Signed Credential Records**, SCR) that eliminates the entire class of JWT vulnerabilities.

**Rationale:**

- **Server-side storage is expensive and fragile.** A traditional ranking server must store every player's rating, match history, and achievements — growing linearly with player count. A Community Server that only issues signed credentials can serve thousands of players from a $5/month VPS because it stores almost nothing. Player data lives on the player's machine (in SQLite, per D034).
- **Federation is already the architecture.** D030/D050 proved that federated sources work for the Workshop. The same model works for multiplayer: players join communities like they subscribe to Workshop sources. Multiple communities coexist — an "Official IC" community, a clan community, a tournament community, a local LAN community. Each tracks its own independent rankings.
- **Local-first matches the privacy design.** D042 already stores player behavioral profiles locally. D034 uses SQLite for all persistent state. Keeping credential files local is the natural extension — players own their data, carry it between machines, and decide who sees it.
- **The relay server already certifies match results.** D007's relay architecture produces `CertifiedMatchResult` (relay-signed match outcomes). The community server receives these, computes rating updates, and signs new credential records. The trust chain is: relay certifies the match happened → community server certifies the rating change.
- **Self-hosting is a core principle.** Any community can run its own server with its own ranking rules, its own matchmaking criteria, and its own competitive identity. The official IC community is just one of many, not a privileged singleton.

### What Is a Community Server?

A Community Server is a unified service endpoint that provides any combination of:

| Capability                | Description                                     | Existing Design                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Workshop source**       | Hosts and distributes mods                      | D030 federation, D050 library                   |
| **Game relay**            | Hosts multiplayer game sessions                 | D007 relay server                               |
| **Ranking authority**     | Tracks player ratings, signs credential records | D041 `RankingProvider` trait, **this decision** |
| **Matchmaking service**   | Matches players by skill, manages lobbies       | P004 (partially resolved by this decision)      |
| **Achievement authority** | Signs achievement unlock records                | D036 achievement system                         |

Operators enable/disable each capability independently. A small clan community might run only relay + ranking. A large competitive community runs everything. The official IC community runs all five. The `ic-server` binary (see D049 § "Netcode ↔ Workshop Cross-Pollination") bundles all capabilities into a single process with feature flags.

### Signed Credential Records (SCR) — Not JWT

Every player interaction with a community produces a **Signed Credential Record**: a compact binary blob signed by the community server's Ed25519 private key. These records are stored in the player's local SQLite credential file and presented to servers for verification.

**Why not JWT?**

JWT (RFC 7519) is the obvious choice for portable signed credentials, but it carries a decade of known vulnerabilities that IC deliberately avoids:

| JWT Vulnerability                   | How It Works                                                                              | IC's SCR Design                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Algorithm confusion (CVE-2015-9235) | `alg` header tricks verifier into using wrong algorithm (e.g., RS256 key as HS256 secret) | **No algorithm field.** Always Ed25519. Hardcoded in verifier, not read from token.                                                        |
| `alg: none` bypass                  | JWT spec allows unsigned tokens; broken implementations accept them                       | **No algorithm negotiation.** Signature always required, always Ed25519.                                                                   |
| JWKS injection / `jku` redirect     | Attacker injects keys via URL-based key discovery endpoints                               | **No URL-based key discovery.** Community public key stored locally at join time. Key rotation uses signed rotation records.               |
| Token replay                        | JWT has no built-in replay protection                                                     | **Monotonic sequence number** per player per record type. Old sequences rejected.                                                          |
| No revocation                       | JWT valid until expiry; requires external blacklists                                      | **Sequence-based revocation.** "Revoke all sequences before N" = one integer per player. Tiny revocation list, not a full token blacklist. |
| Payload bloat                       | Base64(JSON) is verbose. Large payloads inflate HTTP headers.                             | **Binary format.** No base64, no JSON. Typical record: ~200 bytes.                                                                         |

- **`version`** — format version for forward compatibility. Start at 1. Version changes require reissuance.
- **`record_type`** — `0x01` = rating snapshot, `0x02` = match result, `0x03` = achievement, `0x04` = revocation, `0x05` = key rotation.
- **`community_key`** — the community server's Ed25519 public key. Binds the record to exactly one community. Verification uses this key.
- **`player_key`** — the player's Ed25519 public key. This IS the player's identity within the community.
- **`sequence`** — monotonic per-player counter. Each new record increments it. Revocation is "reject all sequences below N." This replaces JWT's lack of revocation with an O(1) check.
- **`issued_at` / `expires_at`** — timestamps. Expired records require a server sync to refresh. Default expiry: 7 days for rating records, never for match/achievement records.
- **`payload`** — record-type-specific binary data (see below).
- **`signature`** — Ed25519 signature over all preceding bytes. Community server's private key never leaves the server.

### Community Credential Store (SQLite)

Each community a player belongs to gets a separate SQLite file in the player's data directory:

| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Player public key        | Yes                  | Yes (registered members list)              |
| Current rating           | Yes (signed SCR)     | Optionally cached for matchmaking          |

| Opponent profiles (D042) | Yes (local analysis) | No                                         |
| Replay files             | Yes (local)          | No                                         |

The community server's persistent storage is approximately: `(player_count × 32 bytes key) + (player_count × 8 bytes revocation)` = ~40 bytes per player. A community of 10,000 players needs ~400KB of server storage. The matchmaking cache adds more, but it's volatile (RAM only, rebuilt from player connections).

### Verification Flow

When a player joins a community game:

```

**Verification is O(1):** One Ed25519 signature check (fast — ~15,000 verifications/sec on modern hardware), one integer comparison (sequence ≥ min_valid), one timestamp comparison (expires_at > now). No database lookup required for the common case.

**Expired credentials:** If a player's rating SCR has expired (default 7 days since last server sync), the server reissues a fresh SCR after verifying the player's identity (challenge-response with the player's Ed25519 private key). This prevents indefinitely using stale ratings.

**New player flow:** First connection to a community → server generates initial rating SCR (Glicko-2 default: 1500 ± 350) → player stores it locally. No pre-existing data needed.

**Offline play:** Local games and LAN matches can proceed without a community server. Results are unsigned. When the player reconnects, unsigned match data can optionally be submitted for retroactive signing (server decides whether to honor it — tournament communities may reject unsigned results).

### Server-Side Validation: What the Community Server Signs and Why

A critical question: why should a community server sign anything? What prevents a player from feeding the server fake data and getting a signed credential for a match they didn't play or a rating they didn't earn?

**The answer: the community server never signs data it didn't produce or verify itself.** A player cannot walk up to the server with a claim ("I'm 1800 rated") and get it signed. Every signed credential is the server's own output — computed from inputs it trusts. This is analogous to a university signing a diploma: the university doesn't sign because the student claims they graduated. It signs because it has records of every class the student passed.

Here is the full trust chain for every type of signed credential:

**Rating SCRs — the server computes the rating, not the player:**

```
Player claims nothing about their rating. The flow is:

1. Two players connect to the relay for a match.
2. The relay (D007) forwards all orders between players (lockstep).
3. The match ends. Both clients report the outcome to the relay.
   - The relay requires BOTH clients to agree on the outcome
     (winner, loser, draw, disconnection). If they disagree,
     the relay flags the match as disputed and does not certify it.
   - For additional integrity, the relay can optionally run a headless
     sim (same deterministic code — Invariant #1) to independently
     verify the outcome. This is expensive but available for ranked
     matches on well-resourced servers.
4. The relay produces a CertifiedMatchResult:
   - Signed by the relay's own key
   - Contains: player keys, game module, map, duration,
     outcome (who won), order hashes, desync status
5. The community server receives the CertifiedMatchResult.
   - Verifies the relay signature (the community server trusts its
     own relay — they're the same process in the bundled deployment,
     or the operator explicitly configures which relay keys to trust).
6. The community server feeds the CertifiedMatchResult into
   RankingProvider::update_ratings() (D041).
7. The RankingProvider computes new Glicko-2 ratings from the
   match outcome + previous ratings.
8. The community server signs the new rating as an SCR.
9. The signed SCR is returned to both players.

At no point does the player provide rating data to the server.
The server computed the rating. The server signs its own computation.
```

**Match SCRs — the relay certifies the match happened:**

The community server signs a match record SCR containing the match metadata (players, map, outcome, duration). This data comes from the `CertifiedMatchResult` which the relay produced. The server doesn't trust the player's claim about the match — it trusts the relay's attestation, because the relay was the network intermediary that observed every order in real time.

**Achievement SCRs — verification depends on context:**

Achievements are more nuanced because they can be earned in different contexts:

| Context                     | How the server validates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Trust level                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiplayer match**       | Achievement condition cross-referenced with `CertifiedMatchResult` data. E.g., "Win 50 matches" — server counts its own signed match SCRs for this player. "Win under 5 minutes" — server checks match duration from the relay's certified result.                                          | **High** — server validates against its own records              |
| **Multiplayer in-game**     | Relay attests that the achievement trigger fired during a live match (the trigger is part of the deterministic sim, so the relay can verify by running headless). Alternatively, both clients attest the trigger fired (same as match outcome consensus).                                   | **High** — relay-attested or consensus-verified                  |
| **Single-player (online)**  | Player submits a replay file. Community server can fast-forward the replay (deterministic sim) to verify the achievement condition was met. Expensive but possible.                                                                                                                         | **Medium** — replay-verified, but replay submission is voluntary |
| **Single-player (offline)** | Player claims the achievement with no server involvement. When reconnecting, the claim can be submitted with the replay for retroactive verification. Community policy decides whether to accept: casual communities may accept on trust, competitive communities may require replay proof. | **Low** — self-reported unless replay-backed                     |

The community server's policy for achievement signing is configurable per community:

```rust
pub enum AchievementPolicy {
    /// Sign any achievement reported by the client (casual community).
    TrustClient,
    /// Sign immediately, but any player can submit a fraud proof
    /// (replay segment) to challenge. If the challenge verifies,
    /// the achievement SCR is revoked via sequence-based revocation.
    /// Inspired by Optimistic Rollup fraud proofs (Optimism, Arbitrum).
    OptimisticWithChallenge {
        challenge_window_hours: u32,  // default: 72
    },
    /// Sign only achievements backed by a CertifiedMatchResult
    /// or relay attestation (competitive community).
    RequireRelayAttestation,
    /// Sign only if a replay is submitted and server-side verification
    /// confirms the achievement condition (strictest, most expensive).
    RequireReplayVerification,
}
```

**`OptimisticWithChallenge` explained:** This policy borrows the core insight from Optimistic Rollups (Optimism, Arbitrum) in the Web3 ecosystem: execute optimistically (assume valid), and only do expensive verification if someone challenges. The server signs the achievement SCR immediately — same speed as `TrustClient`. But a challenge window opens (default 72 hours, configurable) during which any player who was in the same match can submit a **fraud proof**: a replay segment showing the achievement condition wasn't met. The community server fast-forwards the replay (deterministic sim — Invariant #1) to verify the challenge. If the challenge is valid, the achievement SCR is revoked via the existing sequence-based revocation mechanism. If no challenge arrives within the window, the achievement is final.

In practice, most achievements are legitimate, so the challenge rate is near zero — the expensive replay verification almost never runs. This gives the speed of `TrustClient` with the security guarantees of `RequireReplayVerification`. The pattern works because IC's deterministic sim means any disputed claim can be objectively verified from the replay — there's no ambiguity about what happened.

Most communities will use `RequireRelayAttestation` for multiplayer achievements and `TrustClient` or `OptimisticWithChallenge` for single-player achievements. The achievement SCR includes a `verification_level` field so viewers know how the achievement was validated. SCRs issued under `OptimisticWithChallenge` carry a `verification_level: "optimistic"` tag that upgrades to `"verified"` after the challenge window closes without dispute.

**Player registration — identity binding and Sybil resistance:**

When a player first connects to a community, the community server must decide: should I register this person? What stops one person from creating 100 accounts to game the rating system?

Registration is the one area where the community server does NOT have a relay to vouch for the data. The player is presenting themselves for the first time. The server's defenses are layered:

**Layer 1 — Cryptographic identity (always):**

The player presents their Ed25519 public key. The server challenges them to sign a nonce, proving they hold the private key. This establishes *key ownership*, not *personhood*. One person can generate infinite keypairs.

**Layer 2 — Rate limiting (always):**

The server rate-limits new registrations by IP address (e.g., max 3 new accounts per IP per day). This slows mass account creation without requiring any identity verification.

**Layer 3 — Reputation bootstrapping (always):**

New accounts start at the default rating (Glicko-2: 1500 ± 350) with zero match history. The high deviation (± 350) means the system is uncertain about their skill — it will adjust rapidly over the first ~20 matches. A smurf creating a new account to grief low-rated players will be rated out of the low bracket within a few matches.

Fresh accounts carry no weight in the trust system (D053): they have no signed credentials, no community memberships, no achievement history. The "Verified only" lobby filter (D053 trust-based filtering) excludes players without established credential history — exactly the accounts a Sybil attacker would create.

**Layer 4 — Platform binding (optional, configurable per community):**

Community servers can require linking a platform account (Steam, GOG, etc.) at registration. This provides real Sybil resistance — Steam accounts have purchase history, play time, and cost money. The community server doesn't verify the platform directly (it's not a Steam partner). Instead, it asks the player's IC client to provide a platform-signed attestation of account ownership (e.g., a Steam Auth Session Ticket). The server verifies the ticket against the platform's public API.

```rust
pub enum RegistrationPolicy {
    /// Anyone with a valid keypair can register. Lowest friction.
    Open,
    /// Require a valid platform account (Steam, GOG, etc.).
    RequirePlatform(Vec<PlatformId>),
    /// Require a vouching invite from an existing member.
    RequireInvite,
    /// Require solving a challenge (CAPTCHA, email verification, etc.).
    RequireChallenge(ChallengeType),
    /// Combination: e.g., platform OR invite.
    AnyOf(Vec<RegistrationPolicy>),
}
```

**Layer 5 — Community-specific policies (optional):**

| **Email verification** | Player provides email, server sends confirmation link. One account per email.                                                                                                                                     | Medium-security communities                  |
| **Invite-only**        | Existing members generate invite codes. New players must have a code.                                                                                                                                             | Clan servers, private communities            |
| **Vouching**           | An existing member in good standing (e.g., 100+ matches, no bans) vouches for the new player. If the new player cheats, the voucher's reputation is penalized too.                                                | Competitive leagues                          |
| **Probation period**   | New accounts are marked "probationary" for their first N matches (e.g., 10). Probationary players can't play ranked, can't join "Verified only" rooms, and their achievements aren't signed until probation ends. | Balances accessibility with fraud prevention |

These policies are **per-community**. The Official IC Community might use `RequirePlatform(Steam) + Probation(10 matches)`. A clan server uses `RequireInvite`. A casual LAN community uses `Open`. IC doesn't impose a single registration policy — it provides the building blocks and lets community operators assemble the policy that fits their community's threat model.

**Summary — what the server validates before signing each SCR type:**

| SCR Type         | Server validates...                                                  | Trust anchor             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Rating           | Computed by the server itself from relay-certified match results     | Server's own computation |
| Match result     | Relay-signed `CertifiedMatchResult` (both clients agreed on outcome) | Relay attestation        |
| Achievement (MP) | Cross-referenced with match data or relay attestation                | Relay + server records   |
| Achievement (SP) | Replay verification (if required by community policy)                | Replay determinism       |
| Membership       | Registration policy (platform binding, invite, challenge, etc.)      | Community policy         |

The community server is **not** a rubber stamp. It is a **validation authority** that only signs credentials it can independently verify or that it computed itself. The player never provides the data that gets signed — the data comes from the relay, the ranking algorithm, or the community's own registration policy.

### Community Transparency Log

The trust model above establishes that the community server only signs credentials it computed or verified. But who watches the server? A malicious or compromised operator could inflate a friend's rating, issue contradictory records to different players (equivocation), or silently revoke and reissue credentials. Players trust the community, but have no way to *audit* it.

IC solves this with a **transparency log** — an append-only Merkle tree of every SCR the community server has ever issued. This is the same technique Google deployed at scale for [Certificate Transparency](https://certificate.transparency.dev/) (CT, RFC 6962) to prevent certificate authorities from issuing rogue TLS certificates. CT has been mandatory for all publicly-trusted certificates since 2018 and processes billions of entries. The insight transfers directly: a community server is a credential authority, and the same accountability mechanism that works for CAs works here.

**How it works:**

1. Every time the community server signs an SCR, it appends `SHA-256(scr_bytes)` as a leaf in an append-only Merkle tree.
2. The server returns an **inclusion proof** alongside the SCR — a set of O(log N) hashes that proves the SCR exists in the tree at a specific index. The player stores this proof alongside the SCR in their local credential file.
3. The server publishes its current **Signed Tree Head** (STH) — the root hash + tree size + a timestamp + the server's signature — at a well-known endpoint (e.g., `GET /transparency/sth`). This is a single ~128-byte value.
4. **Auditors** (any interested party — players, other community operators, automated monitors) periodically fetch the STH and verify **consistency**: that each new STH is an extension of the previous one (no entries removed or rewritten). This is a single O(log N) consistency proof per check.
5. Players can verify their personal inclusion proofs against the published STH — confirming their SCRs are in the same tree everyone else sees.

Inclusion proof for SCR 2: [H(SCR 3), H(0,1)]
→ Verifier recomputes: H(2,3) = H(H(SCR 2) || H(SCR 3)),
   Root = H(H(0,1) || H(2,3)) → must match published STH root.
```

**What this catches:**

| Attack                                                     | How the transparency log detects it                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rating inflation**                                       | Auditor sees a rating SCR that doesn't follow from prior match results in the log. The Merkle tree includes every SCR — match SCRs and rating SCRs are interleaved, so the full causal chain is visible.                   |
| **Equivocation** (different records for different players) | Two players comparing inclusion proofs against the same STH would find one proof fails — the tree can't contain two contradictory entries at the same index. An auditor monitoring the log catches this directly.          |
| **Silent revocation**                                      | Revocation SCRs are logged like any other record. A player whose credential was revoked can see the revocation in the log and verify it was issued by the server, not fabricated.                                          |
| **History rewriting**                                      | Consistency proofs between successive STHs detect any modification to past entries. The append-only structure means the server can't edit history without publishing a new root that's inconsistent with the previous one. |

**What this does NOT provide:**

- **Correctness of game outcomes.** The log proves the server issued a particular SCR. It doesn't prove the underlying match was played fairly — that's the relay's job (`CertifiedMatchResult`). The log is an accountability layer over the signing layer.
- **Real-time fraud prevention.** A compromised server can still issue a bad SCR. The transparency log ensures the bad SCR is *visible* — it can't be quietly slipped in. Detection is retrospective (auditors find it later), not preventive.

**Operational model:**

- **STH publish frequency:** Configurable per community, default hourly. More frequent = faster detection, more bandwidth. Tournament communities might publish every minute during events.
- **Auditor deployment:** The `ic community audit` CLI command fetches and verifies consistency of a community's transparency log. Players can run this manually. Automated monitors (a cron job, a GitHub Action, a community-run service) provide continuous monitoring. IC provides the tooling; communities decide how to deploy it.
- **Log storage:** The Merkle tree is append-only and grows at ~32 bytes per SCR issued (one hash per leaf). A community that issues 100,000 SCRs has a ~3.2 MB log. This is stored server-side in SQLite alongside the existing community state.
- **Inclusion proof size:** O(log N) hashes. For 100,000 SCRs, that's ~17 hashes × 32 bytes = ~544 bytes per proof. Added to the SCR response, this is negligible.

```rust
/// Signed Tree Head — published periodically by the community server.
pub struct SignedTreeHead {
    pub tree_size: u64,            // Number of SCRs in the log
    pub root_hash: [u8; 32],       // SHA-256 Merkle root
    pub timestamp: i64,            // Unix seconds
    pub community_key: [u8; 32],   // Ed25519 public key
    pub signature: [u8; 64],       // Ed25519 signature over the above
}

/// Inclusion proof returned alongside each SCR.
pub struct InclusionProof {
    pub leaf_index: u64,           // Position in the tree
    pub tree_size: u64,            // Tree size at time of inclusion
    pub path: Vec<[u8; 32]>,      // O(log N) sibling hashes
}

/// Consistency proof between two tree heads.
pub struct ConsistencyProof {
    pub old_size: u64,
    pub new_size: u64,
    pub path: Vec<[u8; 32]>,      // O(log N) hashes
}
```

**Phase:** The transparency log ships with the community server in **Phase 5**. It's an integral part of community accountability, not an afterthought. The `ic community audit` CLI command ships in the same phase. Automated monitoring tooling is Phase 6a.

**Why this isn't blockchain:** A transparency log is a cryptographic data structure maintained by a single authority (the community server), auditable by anyone. It provides non-equivocation and append-only guarantees without distributed consensus, proof-of-work, tokens, or peer-to-peer gossip. The server runs it unilaterally; auditors verify it externally. This is orders of magnitude simpler and cheaper than any blockchain — and it's exactly what's needed. Certificate Transparency protects the entire web's TLS infrastructure using this pattern. It works.

### Matchmaking Design

The community server's matchmaking uses verified ratings from presented SCRs:

```rust
/// Matchmaking pool entry — one per connected player seeking a game.
pub struct MatchmakingEntry {
    pub player_key: Ed25519PublicKey,
    pub verified_rating: PlayerRating,    // From verified SCR
    pub game_module: GameModuleId,        // What game they want to play
    pub preferences: MatchPreferences,    // Map pool, team size, etc.
    pub queue_time: Instant,              // When they started searching
}

/// Server-side matchmaking loop (simplified).
fn matchmaking_tick(pool: &mut Vec<MatchmakingEntry>, provider: &dyn RankingProvider) {
    // Sort by queue time (longest-waiting first)
    pool.sort_by_key(|e| e.queue_time);
    
    for candidate_pair in pool.windows(2) {
        let quality = provider.match_quality(
            &[candidate_pair[0].verified_rating],
            &[candidate_pair[1].verified_rating],
        );
        
        if quality.fairness > FAIRNESS_THRESHOLD || queue_time_exceeded(candidate_pair) {
            // Accept match — create lobby
            create_lobby(candidate_pair);
        }
    }
}
```

**Matchmaking widens over time:** Initial search window is tight (±100 rating). After 30 seconds, widens to ±200. After 60 seconds, ±400. After 120 seconds, accepts any match. This prevents indefinite queues for players at rating extremes.

**Team games:** For 2v2+ matchmaking, the server balances team average ratings. Each player's SCR is individually verified. Team rating = average of individual Glicko-2 ratings.

### Lobby & Room Discovery

Matchmaking (above) handles competitive/ranked play. But most RTS games are casual — "join my friend's game," "let's play a LAN match," "come watch my stream and play." These need a room-based lobby with low-friction discovery. IC provides five discovery tiers, from zero-infrastructure to full game browser. Every tier works on every platform (desktop, browser, mobile — Invariant #10).

**Tier 0 — Direct Connect (IP:port)**

Always available, zero external dependency. Type an IP address and port, connect. Works on LAN, works over internet with port forwarding. This is the escape hatch — if every server is down, two players with IP addresses can still play.

```
ic play connect 192.168.1.42:7400
```

For P2P lockstep (no relay), the host IS the connection target. For relay-hosted games, this is the relay's address. No discovery mechanism needed — you already know where to go.

**Tier 1 — Room Codes (Among Us pattern, decentralized)**

When a host creates a room on any relay or community server, the server assigns a short alphanumeric code. Share it verbally, paste it in Discord, text it to a friend.

```
Room code: TKR-4N7
```

**Code format:**
- 6 characters from an unambiguous set: `23456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ` (30 chars, excludes 0/O, 1/I/L)
- Displayed as `XXX-XXX` for readability
- 30^6 ≈ 729 million combinations — more than enough
- Case-insensitive input (the UI uppercases automatically)
- Codes are ephemeral — exist only in server memory, expire when the room closes + 5-minute grace

**Resolution:** Player enters the code in-game. The client queries all configured community servers in parallel (typically 1–3 HTTP requests). Whichever server recognizes the code responds with connection info (relay address + room ID + required resources). No central "code directory" — every community server manages its own code namespace. Collision across communities is fine because clients verify the code against the responding server.

```
ic play join TKR-4N7
```

**Why Among Us-style codes?** Among Us popularized this pattern because it works for exactly the scenario IC targets: you're in a voice call, someone says "join TKR-4N7," everyone types it in 3 seconds. No URLs, no IP addresses, no friend lists. The friction is nearly zero. For an RTS with 2–8 players, this is the sweet spot.

**Tier 2 — QR Code**

The host's client generates a QR code that encodes a deep link URI:

```
ironcurtain://join/community.example.com/TKR-4N7
```

Scanning the QR code opens the IC client (or the browser version on mobile) and auto-joins the room. Perfect for:

- **LAN parties:** Display QR on the host's screen. Everyone scans with their phone/tablet to join via browser client.
- **Couch co-op:** Scan from a phone to open the WASM browser client on a second device.
- **Streaming:** Overlay QR on stream → viewers scan to join or spectate.
- **In-person events / tournaments:** Print QR on table tents.

The QR code is regenerated if the room code changes (e.g., room migrates to a different relay). The deep link URI scheme (`ironcurtain://`) is registered on desktop; on platforms without scheme registration, the QR can encode an HTTPS URL (`https://play.ironcurtain.gg/join/TKR-4N7`) that redirects to the client or browser version.

**Tier 3 — Game Browser**

Community servers publish their active rooms to a room listing API. The in-game browser aggregates listings from all configured communities — the same federation model as Workshop source aggregation.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Game Browser                                    [Refresh]  │
├──────────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────┬──────┬─────────────┤
│ Room Name    │ Host │ Players │ Map    │ Ping │ Mods        │
├──────────────┼──────┼─────────┼────────┼──────┼─────────────┤
│ Casual 1v1   │ cmdr │ 1/2     │ Arena  │ 23ms │ none        │
│ HD Mod Game  │ alice│ 3/4     │ Europe │ 45ms │ hd-pack 2.1 │
│ Newbies Only │ bob  │ 2/6     │ Desert │ 67ms │ none        │
└──────────────┴──────┴─────────┴────────┴──────┴─────────────┘
```

Filter by: game module (RA/TD), map, player count, ping, mods required, community, password protected. Sort by any column. Auto-refresh on configurable interval.

This is the traditional server browser experience (OpenRA has this, Quake had this, every classic RTS had this). It coexists with room codes — a room visible in the browser also has a room code.

**Tier 4 — Matchmaking Queue (D052)**

Already designed above. Player enters a queue; community server matches by rating. This creates rooms automatically — the player never sees a room code or browser.

**Tier 5 — Deep Links / Invites**

The `ironcurtain://join/...` URI scheme works as a clickable link anywhere that supports URI schemes:

- Discord: paste `ironcurtain://join/official.ironcurtain.gg/TKR-4N7` → click to join
- Browser: HTTPS fallback URL redirects to client or opens browser WASM version
- Steam: Steam rich presence integration → "Join Game" button on friend's profile
- In-game friends list (if implemented): one-click invite sends a deep link

**Discovery summary:**

| Tier | Mechanism      | Requires Server?          | Best For                       | Friction             |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 0    | Direct IP:port | No                        | LAN, development, fallback     | High (must know IP)  |
| 1    | Room codes     | Yes (any relay/community) | Friends, voice chat, casual    | Very low (6 chars)   |
| 2    | QR code        | Yes (same as room code)   | LAN parties, streaming, mobile | Near zero (scan)     |
| 3    | Game browser   | Yes (community servers)   | Finding public games           | Low (browse + click) |
| 4    | Matchmaking    | Yes (community server)    | Competitive/ranked             | Zero (press "Play")  |
| 5    | Deep links     | Yes (same as room code)   | Discord, web, social           | Near zero (click)    |

Tiers 0–2 work with a single self-hosted relay (a $5 VPS or even localhost). No official infrastructure required. Tiers 3–4 require community servers. Tier 5 requires URI scheme registration (desktop) or an HTTPS redirect service (browser).

### Lobby Communication

Once players are in a room, they need to communicate — coordinate strategy before the game, socialize, discuss map picks, or just talk. IC provides text chat, voice chat, and visible player identity in every lobby.

**Text Chat**

All lobby text messages are routed through the relay server (or host in P2P mode) — the same path as game orders. This keeps the trust model consistent: the relay timestamps and sequences messages, making chat moderation actions deterministic and auditable.

```rust
/// Lobby chat message — part of the room protocol, not the sim protocol.
/// Routed through the relay alongside PlayerOrders but on a separate
/// logical channel (not processed by ic-sim).
pub struct LobbyMessage {
    pub sender: PlayerId,
    pub channel: ChatChannel,
    pub content: String,         // UTF-8, max 500 bytes
    pub timestamp: u64,          // relay-assigned, not client-claimed
}

pub enum ChatChannel {
    All,                         // Everyone in the room sees it
    Team(TeamId),                // Team-only (pre-game team selection)
    Whisper(PlayerId),           // Private message to one player
    System,                      // Join/leave/kick notifications (server-generated)
}
```

**Chat features:**

- **Rate limiting:** Max 5 messages per 3 seconds per player. Prevents spam flooding.
- **Message length:** Max 500 bytes UTF-8. Long enough for tactical callouts, short enough to prevent wall-of-text abuse.
- **Host moderation:** Room host can mute individual players (host sends a `MutePlayer` command; relay enforces). Muted players' messages are silently dropped by the relay — other clients never receive them.
- **Persistent for room lifetime:** Chat history is available to newly joining players (last 50 messages). When the room closes, chat is discarded — no server-side chat logging.
- **In-game chat:** During gameplay, the same chat system operates. `All` channel becomes `Spectator` for observers. `Team` channel carries strategic communication. A configurable `AllChat` toggle (default: disabled in ranked) controls whether opponents can see your messages during a match.
- **Links and formatting:** URLs are clickable (opens external browser). No rich text — plain text only. This prevents injection attacks and keeps the UI simple.
- **Emoji:** Standard Unicode emoji are rendered natively. No custom emoji system — keep it simple.
- **Block list:** Players can block others locally. Blocked players' messages are filtered client-side (not server-enforced — the relay doesn't need to know your block list). Block persists across sessions in local SQLite (D034).

**In-game chat UI:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [All] [Team]                          [Hide] │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [SYS] alice joined the room                  │
│ [cmdr] gg ready when you are                 │
│ [alice] let's go desert map?                 │
│ [bob] 👍                                      │
│                                              │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Type message...]                    [Send]  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The chat panel is collapsible (hotkey: Enter to open, Escape to close — standard RTS convention). During gameplay, it overlays transparently so it doesn't obscure the battlefield.

**Voice Chat**

IC includes built-in voice communication using relay-forwarded Opus audio. Voice data never touches the sim — it's a purely transport-layer feature with zero determinism impact.

**Architecture:**

```
┌────────┐              ┌─────────────┐              ┌────────┐
│Player A│─── Opus ────►│ Room Server │─── Opus ────►│Player B│
│        │◄── Opus ─────│  (D052)     │◄── Opus ─────│        │
└────────┘              │             │              └────────┘
                        │  Stateless  │
┌────────┐              │  forwarding │
│Player C│─── Opus ────►│             │
│        │◄── Opus ─────│             │
└────────┘              └─────────────┘
```

- **Relay-forwarded audio:** Voice data flows through the room server (D052), maintaining IP privacy — the same principle as D059's in-game voice design. The room server performs stateless Opus packet forwarding (copies bytes without decoding). This prevents IP exposure, which is a known harassment vector even in the pre-game lobby phase.
- **Lobby → game transition:** When the match starts and clients connect to the game relay, voice seamlessly transitions from the room server to the game relay. No reconnection is needed — the relay assumes voice forwarding from the room server's role. If the room server and game relay are the same process (common for community servers), the transition is a no-op.
- **Push-to-talk (default):** RTS players need both hands on mouse/keyboard during games. Push-to-talk avoids accidental transmission of keyboard clatter, breathing, and background noise. Default keybind: `V`. Voice activation mode available in settings for players who prefer it.
- **Per-player volume:** Each player's voice volume is adjustable independently (right-click their name in the player list → volume slider). Mute individual players with one click.
- **Voice channels:** Mirror text chat channels — All, Team. During gameplay, voice defaults to Team-only to prevent leaking strategy to opponents. Spectators have their own voice channel.
- **Codec:** Opus (standard WebRTC codec). 32 kbps mono is sufficient for clear voice in a game context. Total bandwidth for a full 8-player lobby: ~224 kbps (7 incoming streams × 32 kbps) — negligible compared to game traffic.
- **Browser (WASM) support:** Browser builds use WebRTC via `str0m` for voice (see D059 § VoiceTransport). Desktop builds send Opus packets directly on the `Transport` connection's `MessageLane::Voice`.

**Voice UI indicators:**

```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Players:               │
│  🔊 cmdr (host)   1800 │  ← speaking indicator
│  🔇 alice         1650 │  ← muted by self
│  🎤 bob           1520 │  ← has mic, not speaking
│  📵 carol         ---- │  ← voice disabled
└────────────────────────┘
```

Speaking indicators appear next to player names in the lobby and during gameplay (small icon on the player's color bar in the sidebar). This lets players see who's talking at a glance.

**Privacy and safety:**

- Voice is opt-in. Players can disable voice entirely in settings. The client never activates the microphone without explicit user action (push-to-talk press or voice activation toggle).
- No voice recording by the relay or community server during normal operation. Voice streams are ephemeral in the relay pipeline. (Note: D059 adds opt-in voice-in-replay where consenting players' voice is captured client-side during gameplay — this is client-local recording with consent, not relay-side recording.)
- Abusive voice users can be muted by any player (locally) or by the host (server-enforced kick from voice channel).
- Ranked/competitive rooms can enforce "no voice" or "team-voice-only" policies.

**When external voice is better:** IC's built-in voice is designed for casual lobbies, LAN parties, and pickup games where players don't have a pre-existing Discord/TeamSpeak. Competitive teams will continue using external voice (lower latency, better quality, persistent channels). IC doesn't try to replace Discord — it provides a frictionless default for when Discord isn't set up.

**Player Identity in Lobby**

Every player in a lobby is visible with their profile identity — not just a text name. The lobby player list shows:

- **Avatar:** Small profile image (32×32 in list, 64×64 on hover/click). Sourced from the player's profile (see D053).
- **Display name:** The player's chosen name. If the player has a community-verified identity (D052 SCR), a small badge appears next to the name indicating which community verified them.
- **Rating badge:** If the room is on a community server, the player's verified rating for the relevant game module is shown (from their presented SCR). Unranked players show "—".
- **Presence indicators:** Microphone status, ready state, download progress (if syncing resources).

Clicking a player's name in the lobby opens a **profile card** — a compact view of their player profile (D053) showing avatar, bio, recent achievements, win rate, and community memberships. This lets players gauge each other before a match without leaving the lobby.

The left panel shows players with avatars (small square icons), voice status, community rating badges, and ready state. The right panel is the chat. The layout adapts to screen size (D032 responsive UI) — on narrow screens, chat slides below the player list.

**Phase:** Text chat ships with lobby implementation (Phase 5). Voice chat Phase 5–6a. Profile images in lobby require D053 (Player Profile, Phase 3–5).

### In-Lobby P2P Resource Sharing

When a player joins a room that requires resources (mods, maps, resource packs) they don't have locally, the lobby becomes a P2P swarm for those resources. The relay server (or host in P2P mode) acts as the tracker. This is the existing D049 P2P protocol scoped to a single lobby's resource list.

**Flow:**

```
Host creates room
  → declares required: [alice/hd-sprites@2.0, bob/desert-map@1.1]
  → host seeds both resources

Player joins room
  → receives resource list with SHA-256 from Workshop index
  → checks local cache: has alice/hd-sprites@2.0 ✓, missing bob/desert-map@1.1 ✗

  → Step 1: Verify resource exists in a known Workshop source
    Client fetches manifest for bob/desert-map@1.1 from Workshop index
    (git-index HTTP fetch or Workshop server API)
    Gets: SHA-256, manifest_hash, size, dependencies
    If resource NOT in any configured Workshop source → REFUSE download
    (prevents arbitrary file transfer — Workshop index is the trust anchor)

  → Step 2: Join lobby resource swarm
    Relay/host announces available peers for bob/desert-map@1.1
    Download via BitTorrent protocol from:
      Priority 1: Other lobby players who already have it (lowest latency)
      Priority 2: Workshop P2P swarm (general seeders)
      Priority 3: Workshop HTTP fallback (CDN/GitHub Releases)

  → Step 3: Verify
    SHA-256 of downloaded .icpkg matches Workshop index manifest ✓
    manifest_hash of internal manifest.yaml matches index ✓
    (Same verification chain as regular Workshop install — see V20)

  → Step 4: Report ready
    Client signals lobby: "all resources verified, ready to play"

All players ready → countdown → game starts
```

```

**The host-as-tracker model:**

For relay-hosted games (the default), the relay IS the tracker — it already manages all connections in the room. It maintains an in-memory peer table: which players have which resources. When a new player joins and needs resources, the relay tells them which peers can seed. This is trivial — a `HashMap<ResourceId, Vec<PeerId>>` that lives only as long as the room exists.

For P2P games (no relay, LAN): the host's game client runs a minimal tracker. Same data structure, same protocol, just embedded in the game client instead of a separate relay process. The host was already acting as the game's connection coordinator — adding resource tracking is marginal.

**Security model — preventing malicious content transfer:**

The critical constraint: **only Workshop-published resources can be shared in a lobby.** The lobby declares resources by their Workshop identity (`publisher/package@version`), not by arbitrary file paths. The security chain:

1. **Workshop index is the trust anchor.** Every resource has a SHA-256 and `manifest_hash` recorded in a Workshop index (git-index with signed commits or Workshop server API). The client must be able to look up the resource in a known Workshop source before downloading.
2. **Content verification is mandatory.** After download, the client verifies SHA-256 (full package) and `manifest_hash` (internal manifest) against the Workshop index — not against the host's claim. Even if every other player in the lobby is malicious, a single honest Workshop index protects the downloading player.
3. **Unknown resources are refused.** If a room requires `evil/malware@1.0` and that doesn't exist in any Workshop source the player has configured, the client refuses to download and warns: "Resource not found in any configured Workshop source. Add the community's Workshop source or leave the lobby."
4. **No arbitrary file transfer.** The P2P protocol only transfers `.icpkg` archives that match Workshop-published checksums. There is no mechanism for peers to push arbitrary files — the protocol is pull-only and content-addressed.
5. **Mod sandbox limits blast radius.** Even a resource that passes all integrity checks is still subject to WASM capability sandbox (D005), Lua execution limits (D004), and YAML schema validation (D003). A malicious mod that sneaks past Workshop review can at most affect gameplay within its declared capabilities.
6. **Post-install scanning (Phase 6a+).** When a resource is auto-downloaded in a lobby, the client checks for Workshop security advisories (V18) before loading it. If the resource version has a known advisory → warn the player before proceeding.

**What about custom maps not on the Workshop?**

For early phases (before Workshop exists) or for truly private content: the host can share a map file by embedding it in the room's initial payload (small maps are <1MB). The receiving client:
- Must explicitly accept ("Host wants to share a custom map not published on Workshop. Accept? [Yes/No]")
- The file is verified for format validity (must parse as a valid IC map) but has no Workshop-grade integrity chain
- These maps are quarantined (loaded but not added to the player's Workshop cache)
- This is the "developer/testing" escape hatch — not the normal flow

This escape hatch is disabled by default in competitive/ranked rooms (community servers can enforce "Workshop-only" policies).

**Bandwidth and timing:**

The lobby applies D049's `lobby-urgent` priority tier — auto-downloads preempt background Workshop activity and get full available bandwidth. Combined with the lobby swarm (host + ready players all seeding), typical resource downloads complete in seconds for common mods (<50MB). The download timer can be configured per-community: tournament servers might set a 60-second download window, casual rooms wait indefinitely.

If a player's download is too slow (configurable threshold, e.g., 5 minutes), the lobby UI offers: "Download taking too long. [Keep waiting] [Download in background and spectate] [Leave lobby]".

**Local resource lifecycle:** Resources downloaded via lobby P2P are tagged as **transient** (not pinned). They remain fully functional but auto-clean after `transient_ttl_days` (default 30 days) of non-use. After the session, a post-match toast offers: "[Pin] [Auto-clean in 30 days] [Remove now]". Frequently-used lobby resources (3+ sessions) are automatically promoted to pinned. See D030 § "Local Resource Management" for the full lifecycle.

Default: **Glicko-2** (already specified in D041 as `Glicko2Provider`).

Why Glicko-2 over alternatives:
- **Rating deviation** naturally models uncertainty. New players have wide confidence intervals (RD ~350); experienced players have narrow ones (RD ~50). Matchmaking can use RD to avoid matching a highly uncertain new player against a stable veteran.
- **Inactivity decay:** RD increases over time without play. A player who hasn't played in months is correctly modeled as "uncertain" — their first few games back will move their rating significantly, then stabilize.
- **Open and unpatented.** TrueSkill (Microsoft) and TrueSkill 2 are patented. Glicko-2 is published freely by Mark Glickman.
- **Lichess uses it.** Proven at scale in a competitive community with similar dynamics (skill-based 1v1 with occasional team play).
- **RankingProvider trait (D041)** makes this swappable. Communities that want Elo, or a league/tier system, or a custom algorithm, implement the trait.

**Rating storage in SCR payload** (record_type = 0x01, rating snapshot):

```
rating payload:
  game_module_len   1 byte
  game_module       variable (UTF-8)
  algorithm_id_len  1 byte
  algorithm_id      variable (UTF-8, e.g., "glicko2")
  rating            8 bytes (i64 LE, fixed-point × 1000)
  deviation         8 bytes (i64 LE, fixed-point × 1000)

  draws             4 bytes (u32 LE)
  streak_current    2 bytes (i16 LE, positive = win streak)
  rank_position     4 bytes (u32 LE, 0 = unranked)
  percentile        2 bytes (u16 LE, 0-1000 = 0.0%-100.0%)
```

### Key Lifecycle

#### Key Identification

Every Ed25519 public key — player or community — has a **key fingerprint** for human reference:

```
Fingerprint = SHA-256(public_key)[0..8], displayed as 16 hex chars
Example:     3f7a2b91e4d08c56
```

The fingerprint is a display convenience. Internally, the full 32-byte public key is the canonical identifier (stored in SCRs, credential tables, etc.). Fingerprints appear in the UI for key verification dialogs, rotation notices, and trust management screens.

Why 8 bytes (64 bits) instead of GPG-style 4-byte short IDs? GPG short key IDs (32 bits) famously suffered birthday-attack collisions — an attacker could generate a key with the same 4-byte fingerprint in minutes. 8 bytes requires ~2^32 key generations to find a collision — far beyond practical for the hobbyist community operators IC targets. For cryptographic operations, the full 32-byte key is always used; the fingerprint is only for human eyeball verification.

#### Player Keys

- Generated on first community join. Ed25519 keypair stored encrypted (AEAD with user passphrase) in the player's local config.
- The same keypair CAN be reused across communities (simpler) or the player CAN generate per-community keypairs (more private). Player's choice in settings.
- **Key recovery via mnemonic seed (D061):** The keypair is derived from a 24-word BIP-39 mnemonic phrase. If the player saved the phrase, they can regenerate the identical keypair on any machine via `ic identity recover`. Existing SCRs validate automatically — the recovered key matches the old public key.
- **Key loss without mnemonic:** If the player lost both the keypair AND the recovery phrase, they re-register with the community (new key = new player with fresh rating). This is intentional — unrecoverable key loss resets reputation, preventing key selling.
- **Key export:** `ic player export-key --encrypted` exports the keypair as an encrypted file (AEAD, user passphrase). The mnemonic seed phrase is the preferred backup mechanism; encrypted key export is an alternative for users who prefer file-based backup.

#### Community Keys: Two-Key Architecture

Every community server has **two** Ed25519 keypairs, inspired by DNSSEC's Zone Signing Key (ZSK) / Key Signing Key (KSK) pattern:

| Key                   | Purpose                                                    | Storage                                                     | Usage Frequency                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signing Key (SK)**  | Signs all day-to-day SCRs (ratings, matches, achievements) | On the server, encrypted at rest                            | Every match result, every rating update            |
| **Recovery Key (RK)** | Signs key rotation records and emergency revocations only  | **Offline** — operator saves it, never stored on the server | Rare: only for key rotation or compromise recovery |

**Why two keys?** A single-key system has a catastrophic failure mode: if the key is lost, the community dies (no way to rotate to a new key). If the key is stolen, the attacker can forge credentials *and* the operator can't prove they're the real owner (both parties have the same key). The two-key pattern solves both:
- **Key loss:** Operator uses the RK (stored offline) to sign a rotation to a new SK. Community survives.
- **Key theft:** Operator uses the RK to revoke the compromised SK and rotate to a new one. Attacker has the SK but not the RK, so they can't forge rotation records. Community recovers.
- **Both lost:** Nuclear option — community is dead, players re-register. But losing both requires extraordinary negligence (the RK was specifically generated for offline backup).

This is the same pattern used by DNSSEC (ZSK + KSK), hardware security modules (operational key + root key), cryptocurrency validators (signing key + withdrawal key), and Certificate Authorities (intermediate + root certificates).

The RK private key is shown exactly once during `ic community init`. The server stores only the RK's *public* key (so clients can verify rotation records signed by the RK). The RK private key is never written to disk by the server.

| Emergency rotation (SK lost/stolen) | `ic community emergency-rotate --recovery-key <rk>`            | Generates a new SK, signs a rotation record with the RK: "RK revokes old_SK, authorizes new_SK". The only operation that uses the RK. |
| Regenerate RK                       | `ic community regenerate-recovery-key --recovery-key <old_rk>` | Generates a new RK, signs a rotation record: "old_RK → new_RK". The old RK authorizes the new one.                                    |

#### Key Rotation (Voluntary)

Good security hygiene is to rotate signing keys periodically — not because Ed25519 keys weaken over time, but to limit the blast radius of an undetected compromise. IC makes voluntary rotation seamless:

1. Operator runs `ic community rotate-signing-key`.
2. Server generates a new SK keypair.
3. Server signs a **key rotation record** with the OLD SK:

```rust
pub struct KeyRotationRecord {
    pub record_type: u8,          // 0x05 = key rotation
    pub old_key: [u8; 32],        // SK being retired
    pub new_key: [u8; 32],        // replacement SK
    pub signed_by: KeyRole,       // SK (voluntary) or RK (emergency)
    pub reason: RotationReason,
    pub effective_at: i64,        // Unix timestamp
    pub old_key_valid_until: i64, // grace period end (default: +30 days)
    pub signature: [u8; 64],      // signed by old_key or recovery_key
}

pub enum KeyRole {
    SigningKey,    // voluntary rotation — signed by old SK
    RecoveryKey,   // emergency rotation — signed by RK
}

pub enum RotationReason {
    Scheduled,         // periodic rotation (good hygiene)
    ServerMigration,   // moving to new hardware
    Compromise,        // SK compromised, emergency revocation
    PrecautionaryRevoke, // SK might be compromised, revoking as precaution
}
```

4. Server starts signing new SCRs with the new SK immediately.
5. Clients encountering the rotation record verify it (against the old SK for voluntary rotation, or against the RK for emergency rotation).
6. Clients update their stored community key.
7. **Grace period (30 days default):** During the grace period, clients accept SCRs signed by EITHER the old or new SK. This handles players who cached credentials signed by the old key and haven't synced yet.
8. After the grace period, only the new SK is accepted.

#### Key Compromise Recovery

If a community operator discovers (or suspects) their SK has been compromised:

1. **Immediate response:** Run `ic community emergency-rotate --recovery-key <rk>`.
2. Server generates a new SK.
3. Server signs an **emergency rotation record** with the **Recovery Key**:
   - `signed_by: RecoveryKey`
   - `reason: Compromise` (or `PrecautionaryRevoke`)
   - `old_key_valid_until: now` (no grace period for compromised keys — immediate revocation)
4. Clients encountering this record verify it against the RK public key (cached since community join).
5. **Compromise window SCRs:** SCRs issued between the compromise and the rotation are potentially forged. The rotation record includes the `effective_at` timestamp. Clients can flag SCRs signed by the old key after this timestamp as "potentially compromised" (⚠️ in the UI). SCRs signed before the compromise window remain valid — the key was legitimate when they were issued.
6. **Attacker is locked out:** The attacker has the old SK but not the RK. They cannot forge rotation records, so clients who receive the legitimate RK-signed rotation will reject the attacker's old-SK-signed SCRs going forward.

**What about third-party compromise reports?** ("Someone told me community X's key was stolen.")

IC does **not** support third-party key revocation. Only the RK holder can revoke an SK. This is the same model as PGP — only the key owner can issue a revocation certificate. If you suspect a community's key is compromised but they haven't rotated:
- Remove them from your trusted communities list (D053). This is your defense.
- Contact the community operator out-of-band (Discord, email, their website) to alert them.
- The community appears as ⚠️ Untrusted in profiles of players who removed them.

Central revocation authorities (CRLs, OCSP) require central infrastructure — exactly what IC's federated model avoids. The tradeoff is that compromise propagation depends on the operator's responsiveness. This is acceptable: IC communities are run by the same people who already manage Discord servers, game servers, and community websites. They're reachable.

#### Key Expiry Policy

**Community keys (SK and RK) do NOT expire.** This is an explicit design choice.

Arguments for expiry (and why they don't apply):

| Argument                               | Counterpoint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Limits damage from silent compromise" | SCRs already have per-record `expires_at` (7 days default for ratings). A silently compromised key can only forge SCRs that expire in a week. Voluntary key rotation provides the same benefit without forced expiry.                                                                                |
| "Forces rotation hygiene"              | IC's community operators are hobbyists running $5 VPSes. Forced expiry creates an operational burden that causes more harm (communities dying from forgotten renewal) than good. Let rotation be voluntary.                                                                                          |
| "TLS certs expire"                     | TLS operates in a CA trust model with automated renewal (ACME/Let's Encrypt). IC has no CA and no automated renewal infrastructure. The analogy doesn't hold.                                                                                                                                        |
| "What if the operator disappears?"     | SCR `expires_at` handles this naturally. If the server goes offline, rating SCRs expire within 7 days and become un-refreshable. The community dies gracefully — players' old match/achievement SCRs (which have `expires_at: never`) remain verifiable, but ratings go stale. No key expiry needed. |

The correct analogy is SSH host keys (never expire, TOFU model) and PGP keys (no forced expiry, voluntary rotation or revocation), not TLS certificates.

**However, IC nudges operators toward good hygiene:**
- The server logs a warning if the SK hasn't been rotated in 12 months: "Consider rotating your signing key. Run `ic community rotate-signing-key`." This is a reminder, not an enforcement.
- The client shows a subtle indicator if a community's SK is older than 24 months: small 🕐 icon next to the community name. This is informational, not blocking.

#### Client-Side Key Storage

When a player joins a community, the client receives and caches both public keys:

```sql
-- In the community credential store (community_info table)
CREATE TABLE community_info (
    community_key       BLOB NOT NULL,     -- Current SK public key (32 bytes)
    recovery_key        BLOB NOT NULL,     -- RK public key (32 bytes) — cached at join
    community_name      TEXT NOT NULL,
    server_url          TEXT NOT NULL,
    key_fingerprint     TEXT NOT NULL,     -- hex(SHA-256(community_key)[0..8])
    rk_fingerprint      TEXT NOT NULL,     -- hex(SHA-256(recovery_key)[0..8])
    sk_rotated_at       INTEGER,           -- when current SK was activated
    joined_at           INTEGER NOT NULL,
    last_sync           INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Key rotation history (for audit trail)
CREATE TABLE key_rotations (
    sequence        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    old_key         BLOB NOT NULL,         -- retired SK public key
    new_key         BLOB NOT NULL,         -- replacement SK public key
    signed_by       TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'signing_key' or 'recovery_key'
    reason          TEXT NOT NULL,
    effective_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    grace_until     INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- old key accepted until this time
    rotation_record BLOB NOT NULL          -- full signed rotation record bytes
);
```

The `key_rotations` table provides an audit trail: the client can verify the entire chain of key rotations from the original key (cached at join time) to the current key. This means even if a client was offline for months and missed several rotations, they can verify the chain: "original_SK → SK2 (signed by original_SK) → SK3 (signed by SK2) → current_SK (signed by SK3)." If any link in the chain breaks, the client alerts the user.

#### Revocation (Player-Level)

- The community server signs a revocation record: `(record_type, min_valid_sequence, signature)`.
- Clients encountering a revocation update their local `revocations` table.
- Verification checks: `scr.sequence >= revocations[scr.record_type].min_valid_sequence`.
- Use case: player caught cheating → server issues revocation for all their records below a new sequence → player's cached credentials become unverifiable → they must re-authenticate, and the server can refuse.

Revocations are distinct from key rotations. Revocations invalidate a specific player's credentials. Key rotations replace the community's signing key. Both use signed records; they solve different problems.

#### Social Recovery (Optional, for Large Communities)

The two-key system has one remaining single point of failure: the RK itself. If the sole operator loses the RK private key (hardware failure, lost USB drive) AND the SK is also compromised, the community is dead. For small clan servers this is acceptable — the operator is one person who backs up their key. For large communities (1,000+ members, years of match history), the stakes are higher.

**Social recovery** eliminates this single point by distributing the RK across multiple trusted people using **Shamir's Secret Sharing** (SSS). Instead of one person holding the RK, the community designates N **recovery guardians** — trusted community members who each hold a shard. A threshold of K shards (e.g., 3 of 5) is required to reconstruct the RK and sign an emergency rotation.

This pattern comes from Ethereum's account abstraction ecosystem (ERC-4337, Argent wallet, Vitalik Buterin's 2021 social recovery proposal), adapted for IC's community key model. The Web3 ecosystem spent years refining social recovery UX because key loss destroyed real value — IC benefits from those lessons without needing a blockchain.

**Setup:**

```
$ ic community setup-social-recovery --guardians 5 --threshold 3

  Social Recovery Setup
  ─────────────────────
  Your Recovery Key will be split into 5 shards.
  Any 3 shards can reconstruct it.

  Enter guardian identities (player keys or community member names):
    Guardian 1: alice   (player_key: 3f7a2b91...)
    Guardian 2: bob     (player_key: 9c4d17e3...)
    Guardian 3: carol   (player_key: a1b2c3d4...)
    Guardian 4: dave    (player_key: e5f6a7b8...)
    Guardian 5: eve     (player_key: 12345678...)

  Generating shards...
  Each guardian will receive their shard encrypted to their player key.
  Shards are transmitted via the community server's secure channel.

  ⚠️  Store the guardian list securely. You need 3 of these 5 people
     to recover your community if the Recovery Key is lost.

  [Confirm and distribute shards]
```

**How it works:**

1. The RK private key is split into N shards using Shamir's Secret Sharing over the Ed25519 scalar field.
2. Each shard is encrypted to the guardian's player public key (X25519 key agreement + AEAD) and transmitted.
3. Guardians store their shard locally (in their player credential SQLite, encrypted at rest).
4. The operator's server stores only the guardian list (public keys + shard indices) — never the shards themselves.
5. To perform emergency rotation, K guardians each decrypt and submit their shard to a recovery coordinator (can be the operator's new server, or any guardian). The coordinator reconstructs the RK, signs the rotation record, and discards the reconstructed key.
6. After recovery, new shards should be generated (the old shards reconstructed the old RK; a fresh `setup-social-recovery` generates shards for a new RK).

**Guardian management:**

| Operation              | Command                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set up social recovery | `ic community setup-social-recovery --guardians N --threshold K`                          |
| Replace a guardian     | `ic community replace-guardian <old> <new> --recovery-key <rk>` (requires RK to re-shard) |
| Check guardian status  | `ic community guardian-status` (pings guardians, verifies they still hold valid shards)   |
| Initiate recovery      | `ic community social-recover` (collects K shards, reconstructs RK, rotates SK)            |

**Guardian liveness:** `ic community guardian-status` periodically checks (opt-in, configurable interval) whether guardians are still reachable and their shards are intact (guardians sign a challenge with their player key; possession of the shard is verified via a zero-knowledge proof of shard validity, not by revealing the shard). If a guardian is unreachable for 90+ days, the operator is warned: "Guardian dave has been unreachable for 94 days. Consider replacing them."

**Why not just use N independent RKs?** With N independent RKs, any single compromise recovers the full key — the security level degrades as N increases. With Shamir's threshold scheme, compromising K-1 guardians reveals *zero information* about the RK. This is information-theoretically secure, not just computationally secure.

**Rust crate:** `sharks` (Shamir's Secret Sharing, permissively licensed, well-audited). Alternatively `vsss-rs` (Verifiable Secret Sharing — adds the property that each guardian can verify their shard is valid without learning the secret, preventing a malicious dealer from distributing fake shards).

**Phase:** Social recovery is optional and ships in Phase 6a. The two-key system (Phase 5) works without it. Communities that want social recovery enable it as an upgrade — it doesn't change any existing key management flows, just adds a recovery path.

### Cross-Community Interoperability

Communities are independent ranking domains — a 1500 rating on "Official IC" means nothing on "Clan Wolfpack." This is intentional: different communities can run different game modules, balance presets (D019), and matchmaking rules.

**However, portable proofs are useful:**
- "I have 500+ matches on the official community" — provable by presenting signed match SCRs.
- "I achieved 'Iron Curtain' achievement on Official IC" — provable by presenting the signed achievement SCR.
- A tournament community can require "minimum 50 rated matches on any community with verifiable SCRs" as an entry requirement.

**Cross-domain credential principle:** Cross-community credential presentation is architecturally a "bridge" — data signed in Domain A is presented in Domain B. The most expensive lessons in Web3 were bridge hacks (Ronin $625M, Wormhole $325M, Nomad $190M), all caused by trusting cross-domain data without sufficient validation at the boundary. IC's design is already better than most Web3 bridges (each verifier independently checks Ed25519 signatures locally, no intermediary trusted), but the following principle should be explicit:

> **Cross-domain credentials are read-only.** Community Y can *display* and *verify* credentials signed by Community X, but must never *update its own state* based on them without independent re-verification. If Community Y grants a privilege based on Community X membership (e.g., "skip probation if you have 100+ matches on Official IC"), it must re-verify the SCR at the moment the privilege is exercised — not cache the check from an earlier session. Stale cached trust checks are the root cause of bridge exploits: the external state changed (key rotated, credential revoked), but the receiving domain still trusted its cached approval.

In practice, this means:
- Trust requirements (D053 `TrustRequirement`) re-verify SCRs on every room join, not once per session.
- Matchmaking checks re-verify rating SCRs before each match, not at queue entry.
- Tournament entry requirements re-verify all credential conditions at match start, not at registration.
- The `expires_at` field on SCRs (default 7 days for ratings) provides a natural staleness bound, but point-of-use re-verification catches revocations within the validity window.

This costs one Ed25519 signature check (~65μs) per verification — negligible even at thousands of verifications per second.

**Cross-community rating display (V29):**

Foreign credentials displayed in lobbies and profiles must be visually distinct from the current community's ratings to prevent misrepresentation:

- **Full-color** tier badge for the current community's rating. **Desaturated/outlined** badge for credentials from other communities, with the issuing community name in small text.
- Matchmaking always uses the **current community's** rating. Foreign ratings never influence matchmaking — a "Supreme Commander" from another server starts at default rating + placement deviation when joining a new community.
- **Optional seeding hint:** Community operators MAY configure foreign credentials as a seeding signal during placement (weighted at 30% — a foreign 2400 seeds at ~1650, not 2400). Disabled by default. This is a convenience, not a trust assertion.

**Leaderboards:**
- Each community maintains its own leaderboard, compiled from the rating SCRs it has issued.
- The community server caches current ratings (in RAM or SQLite) for leaderboard display.
- Players can view their own full match history locally (from their SQLite credential file) without server involvement.

### Community Server Operational Requirements

| Metric                                              | Estimate                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Storage per player                                  | ~40 bytes persistent (key + revocation). ~200 bytes cached (rating for matchmaking) |
| Storage for 10,000 players                          | ~2.3 MB                                                                             |
| RAM for matchmaking (1,000 concurrent)              | ~200 KB                                                                             |
| CPU per match result signing                        | ~1ms (Ed25519 sign is ~60μs; rest is rating computation)                            |
| Bandwidth per match result                          | ~500 bytes (2 SCRs returned: rating + match)                                        |
| Monthly VPS cost (small community, <1000 players)   | $5–10                                                                               |
| Monthly VPS cost (large community, 10,000+ players) | $20–50                                                                              |

This is cheaper than any centralized ranking service. Operating a community is within reach of a single motivated community member — the same people who already run OpenRA servers and Discord bots.

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D007 (Relay server):** The relay produces `CertifiedMatchResult` — the input to rating computation. A Community Server bundles relay + ranking in one process.
- **D030/D050 (Workshop federation):** Community Servers federate like Workshop sources. `settings.yaml` lists communities the same way it lists Workshop sources.
- **D034 (SQLite):** The credential file IS SQLite. The community server's small state IS SQLite.
- **D036 (Achievements):** Achievement records are SCRs stored in the credential file. The community server is the signing authority.
- **D041 (RankingProvider trait):** Matchmaking uses `RankingProvider` implementations. Community operators choose their algorithm.
- **D042 (Player profiles):** Behavioral profiles remain local-only (D042). The credential file holds signed competitive data (ratings, matches, achievements). They complement each other: D042 = private local analytics, D052 = portable signed reputation.
- **P004 (Lobby/matchmaking):** This decision partially resolves P004. Room discovery (5 tiers), lobby P2P resource sharing, and matchmaking are now designed. The remaining Phase 5 work is wire format specifics (message framing, serialization, state machine transitions).

### Alternatives Considered

- **Centralized ranking database** (rejected — expensive to host, single point of failure, doesn't match IC's federation model, violates local-first privacy principle)
- **JWT for credentials** (rejected — algorithm confusion attacks, `alg: none` bypass, JSON parsing ambiguity, no built-in replay protection, no built-in revocation. See comparison table above)
- **Blockchain/DLT for rankings** (rejected — massively overcomplicated for this use case, environmental concerns, no benefit over Ed25519 signed records)
- **Per-player credential chaining (prev_hash linking)** (evaluated, rejected — would add a 32-byte `prev_hash` field to each SCR, linking each record to its predecessor in a per-player hash chain. Goal: guarantee completeness of match history presentation, preventing players from hiding losses. Rejected because: the server-computed rating already reflects all matches — the rating IS the ground truth, and a player hiding individual match SCRs can't change their verified rating. The chain also creates false positives when legitimate credential file loss/corruption breaks the chain, requires the server to track per-player chain heads adding state proportional to `N_players × N_record_types`, and complicates the clean "verify signature, check sequence" flow for a primarily cosmetic concern. The transparency log — which audits the *server*, not the player — is the higher-value accountability mechanism.)
- **Web-of-trust (players sign each other's match results)** (rejected — Sybil attacks trivially game this; a trusted community server as signing authority is simpler and more resistant)
- **PASETO (Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens)** (considered — fixes many JWT flaws, mandates modern algorithms. Rejected because: still JSON-based, still has header/payload/footer structure that invites parsing issues, and IC's binary SCR format is more compact and purpose-built. PASETO is good; SCR is better for this niche.)

### Phase

Community Server infrastructure ships in **Phase 5** (Multiplayer & Competitive, Months 20–26). The SCR format and credential SQLite schema are defined early (Phase 2) to support local testing with mock community servers.

- **Phase 2:** SCR format crate, local credential store, mock community server for testing.
- **Phase 5:** Full community server (relay + ranking + matchmaking + achievement signing). `ic community join/leave/status` CLI commands. In-game community browser.
- **Phase 6a:** Federation between communities. Community discovery. Cross-community credential presentation. Community reputation.

### Cross-Pollination: Lessons Flowing Between D052/D053, Workshop, and Netcode

The work on community servers, trust chains, and player profiles produced patterns that strengthen Workshop and netcode designs — and vice versa. This section catalogues the cross-system lessons beyond the four shared infrastructure opportunities already documented in D049 (unified `ic-server` binary, federation library, auth/identity layer, EWMA scoring).

#### D052/D053 → Workshop (D030/D049/D050)

**1. Two-key architecture for Workshop index signing.**

The Workshop's git-index security (D049) plans a single Ed25519 key for signing `index.yaml`. That's the same single-point-of-failure the two-key architecture (§ Key Lifecycle above) was designed to eliminate. CI pipeline compromise is one of the most common supply-chain attack vectors (SolarWinds, Codecov, ua-parser-js). The SK+RK pattern maps directly:

- **Index Signing Key (SK):** Held by CI, used to sign every `index.yaml` build. Rotated periodically or on compromise.
- **Index Recovery Key (RK):** Held offline by ≥2 project maintainers (threshold signing or independent copies). Used solely to sign a `KeyRotationRecord` that re-anchors trust to a new SK.

If CI is compromised, the attacker gets SK but not RK. Maintainers rotate via RK — clients that verify the rotation chain continue trusting the index. Without two-key, CI compromise means either (a) the attacker signs malicious indexes indefinitely, or (b) the project mints a new key and every client must manually re-trust it. The rotation chain avoids both.

**2. Publisher two-key identity.**

Individual mod publishers currently authenticate via GitHub account (Phase 0–3) or Workshop server credentials (Phase 4+). If alice's account is compromised, her packages can be poisoned. The two-key pattern extends to publishers:

- **Publisher Signing Key (SK):** Used to sign each `.icpkg` manifest on publish. Stored on the publisher's development machine.
- **Publisher Recovery Key (RK):** Generated at first publish. Stored offline (e.g., USB key, password manager). Used only to rotate the SK if compromised.

Clients that cache alice's public key can verify her packages remain authentic through key rotations. The `KeyRotationRecord` struct from D052 is reusable — same format, same verification logic, different context. This also enables package pinning: `ic mod pin alice/tanks --key <fingerprint>` refuses installs signed by any other key, even if alice's Workshop account is hijacked.

**3. Trust-based Workshop source filtering.**

D053's `TrustRequirement` model (None / AnyCommunityVerified / SpecificCommunities) maps to Workshop sources. Currently, `settings.yaml` implicitly trusts all configured sources equally. Applying D053's trust tiers:

- **Trusted source:** `ic mod install` proceeds silently.
- **Known source:** Install proceeds with an informational note.
- **Unknown source:** `ic mod install` warns and requires `--allow-untrusted` flag (or interactive confirmation).

This is the same UX pattern as the game browser trust badges — ✅/⚠️/❌ — applied to the `ic` CLI and in-game mod browser. When a dependency chain pulls a package from an untrusted source, the solver surfaces this clearly before proceeding.

**4. Server-side validation principle as shared invariant.**

D052's explicit principle — "never sign data you didn't produce or verify" — should be a shared invariant across all IC server components. For the Workshop server, this means:

- Never accept a publish without verifying: SHA-256 matches, manifest is valid YAML, version doesn't already exist, publisher key matches the namespace, no path traversal in file entries.
- Never sign a package listing without recomputing checksums from the stored `.icpkg`.
- Workshop server attestation: a `CertifiedPublishResult` (analogous to the relay's `CertifiedMatchResult`) signed by the server, proving the publish was validated. Stored in the publisher's local credential file — portable proof that "this package was accepted by Workshop server X at time T."

**5. Registration policies → Workshop publisher policies.**

D052's `RegistrationPolicy` enum (Open / RequirePlatform / RequireInvite / RequireChallenge / AnyOf) maps to Workshop publisher onboarding. A community-hosted Workshop server can configure who may publish:

- `Open` — anyone can publish (appropriate for experimental/testing servers)
- `RequirePlatform` — must have a linked Steam/platform account
- `RequireInvite` — existing publisher must vouch (prevents spam/typosquat floods)

This is already implicit in the git-index phase (GitHub account = identity), but should be explicit in the Workshop server design for Phase 4+.

#### D052/D053 → Netcode (D007/D003)

**6. Relay server two-key pattern.**

Relay servers produce signed `CertifiedMatchResult` records — the trust anchor for all competitive data. If a relay's signing key leaks, all match results are forgeable. Same SK+RK solution: relay operators generate a signing key (used by the running relay binary) and a recovery key (stored offline). On compromise, the operator rotates via RK without invalidating the community's entire match history.

Currently D052 says a community server "trusts its own relay" — but this trust should be cryptographically verifiable: the community server knows the relay's public key (registered in `community_info`), and the `CertifiedMatchResult` carries the relay's signature. Key rotation propagates through the same `KeyRotationRecord` chain.

**7. Trust-verified P2P peer selection.**

D049's P2P peer scoring selects peers by capacity, locality, seed status, and lobby context. D053's trust model adds a fifth dimension: when downloading mods from lobby peers, prefer peers with verified profiles from trusted communities. A verified player is less likely to serve malicious content (Sybil nodes have no community history). The scoring formula gains an optional trust component:

```
PeerScore = Capacity(0.35) + Locality(0.25) + SeedStatus(0.2) + Trust(0.1) + LobbyContext(0.1)
```

Trust scoring: verified by a trusted community = 1.0, verified by any community = 0.5, unverified = 0. This is opt-in — communities that don't care about trust verification keep the original 4-factor formula.

#### Workshop/Netcode → D052/D053

**8. Profile fetch rate control.**

Netcode uses three-layer rate control (per-connection, per-IP, global). Profile fetching in lobbies is susceptible to the same abuse patterns — a malicious client could spam profile requests to exhaust server bandwidth or enumerate player data. The same rate-control architecture applies: per-IP rate limits on profile fetch requests, exponential backoff on repeated fetches of the same profile, and a TTL cache that makes duplicate requests a local cache hit.

**9. Content integrity hashing for composite profiles.**

The Workshop uses SHA-256 checksums plus `manifest_hash` for double verification. When a player assembles their composite profile (identity + SCRs from multiple communities), the assembled profile can include a composite hash — enabling cache invalidation without re-fetching every individual SCR. When a profile is requested, the server returns the composite hash first; if it matches the cached version, no further transfer is needed. This is the same "content-addressed fetch" pattern the Workshop uses for `.icpkg` files.

**10. EWMA scoring for community member standing.**

The Workshop's EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) peer scoring — already identified as shared infrastructure in D049 — has a concrete consumer in D052/D053: community member standing. A community server can track per-member quality signals (connection stability, disconnect rate, desync frequency, report count) using time-decaying EWMA scores. Recent behavior weighs more than ancient history. This feeds into matchmaking preferences (D052) and the profile's community standing display (D053) without requiring a separate scoring system.

#### Shared pattern: key management as reusable infrastructure

The two-key architecture now appears in three contexts: community servers, relay servers, and Workshop (index + publishers). This suggests extracting it as a shared `ic-crypto` module (or section of `ic-protocol`) that provides:

- `SigningKeypair` + `RecoveryKeypair` generation
- `KeyRotationRecord` creation and chain verification
- Fingerprint computation and display formatting
- Common serialization for the rotation chain

All three consumers use Ed25519, the same rotation record format, and the same verification logic. The only difference is context (what the key signs). This is a Phase 2 deliverable — the crypto primitives must exist before community servers, relays, or Workshop servers use them.

| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status**     | Accepted                                                                                                                                |
| **Driver**     | Players need a persistent identity, social presence, and reputation display across lobbies, game browser, and community participation   |
| **Depends on** | D034 (SQLite), D036 (Achievements), D042 (Behavioral Profiles), D046 (Premium Content), D050 (Workshop), D052 (Community Servers & SCR) |

### Problem

Players in multiplayer games are more than a text name. They need to express their identity, showcase achievements, verify reputation, and build social connections. Without a proper profile system, lobbies feel anonymous and impersonal — players can't distinguish veterans from newcomers, can't build persistent friendships, and can't verify who they're playing against. Every major gaming platform (Steam, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Battle.net, Riot Games, Discord) has learned this: **profiles are the social foundation of a gaming community.**

IC has a unique advantage: the Signed Credential Record (SCR) system from D052 means player reputation data (ratings, match counts, achievements) is **cryptographically verified and portable**. No other game has unforgeable, cross-community reputation badges. D053 builds the user-facing system that displays and manages this identity.

### Design Principles

Drawn from analysis of Steam, Xbox Live, PSN, Riot Games, Blizzard Battle.net, Discord, and OpenRA:

1. **Identity expression without vanity bloat.** Players should personalize their presence (avatar, name, bio) but the system shouldn't become a cosmetic storefront that distracts from gameplay. Keep it clean and functional.
2. **Reputation is earned, not claimed.** Ratings, achievements, and match counts come from signed SCRs — not self-reported. If a player claims to be 1800-rated, their profile proves (or disproves) it.
3. **Privacy by default.** Every profile field has visibility controls. Players choose exactly what they share and with whom. Local behavioral data (D042) is never exposed in profiles.
4. **Portable across communities.** A player's profile works on any community server they join. Community-specific data (ratings, achievements) is signed by that community. Cross-community viewing shows aggregated identity with per-community verification badges.
5. **Offline-first.** The profile is stored locally in SQLite (D034). Community-signed data is cached in the local credential store (D052). No server connection needed to view your own profile. Others' profiles are fetched and cached on first encounter.
6. **Platform-integrated where possible.** On Steam, friends lists and presence come from Steam's API via `PlatformServices`. On standalone builds, IC provides its own social graph backed by community servers. Both paths converge at the same profile UI.

### Profile Structure

A player profile contains these sections, each with its own visibility controls:

**1. Identity Core**

| Field         | Description                                                             | Source                                    | Max Size                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Display Name  | Primary visible name                                                    | Player-set, locally stored                | 32 chars                |
| Avatar        | Profile image                                                           | Pre-built gallery or custom upload        | 128×128 PNG, max 64 KB  |
| Banner        | Profile background image                                                | Pre-built gallery or custom upload        | 600×200 PNG, max 128 KB |
| Bio           | Short self-description                                                  | Player-written                            | 500 chars               |
| Player Title  | Earned or selected title (e.g., "Iron Commander", "Mammoth Enthusiast") | Achievement reward or community grant     | 48 chars                |
| Faction Crest | Preferred faction emblem (displayed on profile card)                    | Player-selected from game module factions | Enum per game module    |

**Display names** are not globally unique. Uniqueness is per-community (the community server enforces its own name policy). In a lobby, players are identified by `display_name + community_badge` or `display_name + player_key_prefix` when no community is shared. This matches how Discord handles names post-2023 (display names are cosmetic, uniqueness is contextual).

**Avatar system:**

- **Pre-built gallery:** Ships with ~60 avatars extracted from C&C unit portraits, faction emblems, and structure icons (using game assets the player already owns — loaded by `ra-formats`, not distributed by IC). Each game module contributes its own set.
- **Custom upload:** Players can set any 128×128 PNG image (max 64 KB) as their avatar. The image is stored in the local profile. When joining a lobby, only the SHA-256 hash is transmitted (32 bytes). Other clients fetch the actual image on demand from the player (via the relay, same channel as P2P resource sharing from D052). Fetched avatars are cached locally.
- **Content moderation:** Custom avatars are not moderated by IC (no central server to moderate). Community servers can optionally enforce "gallery-only avatars" as a room policy. Players can report abusive avatars to community moderators via the same mechanism used for reporting cheaters (D052 revocation).
- **Hash-based deduplication:** Two players using the same custom avatar send the same hash. The image is fetched once and shared from cache. This also means pre-built gallery avatars never need network transfer — both clients have them locally.

```rust
pub struct PlayerAvatar {
    pub source: AvatarSource,
    pub hash: [u8; 32],          // SHA-256 of the PNG data
}

pub enum AvatarSource {
    Gallery { module: GameModuleId, index: u16 },  // Pre-built
    Custom,                                          // Player-uploaded PNG
}
```

**2. Achievement Showcase**

Players can **pin up to 6 achievements** to their profile from their D036 achievement collection. Pinned achievements appear prominently on the profile card and in lobby hover tooltips.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ★ Achievements (3 pinned / 47 total)                 │
│  🏆 Iron Curtain           Survived 100 Ion Cannons  │
│  🎖️ Desert Fox             Win 50 Desert maps        │
│  ⚡ Blitz Commander         Win under 5 minutes       │
│                                                      │
│  [View All Achievements →]                           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Pinned achievements are verified: each has a backing SCR from the relevant community. Viewers can inspect the credential (signed by community X, earned on date Y).
- Achievement rarity is shown when viewing the full achievement list: "Earned by 12% of players on this community."
- Mod-defined achievements (D036) appear in the profile just like built-in ones — they're all SCRs.

**3. Statistics Card**

A summary of the player's competitive record, sourced from verified SCRs (D052). Statistics are **per-community, per-game-module** — a player might be 1800 in RA1 on Official IC but 1400 in TD on Clan Wolfpack.

```

```

- **Rank tier badge (D055):** Resolved from the game module's `ranked-tiers.yaml` configuration. Shows current tier + division and peak tier this season. Icon and color from the tier definition.
- **Rating graph:** Visual chart showing rating over time (last 50 matches). Rendered client-side from match SCR timestamps and rating deltas.
- **Faction distribution:** Calculated from match SCRs. Displayed as a simple bar or pie.
- **Playtime:** Estimated from match durations in local match history. Approximate — not a verified claim.
- **Win streak:** Current and best, calculated client-side from match SCRs.
- All numbers come from signed credential records. If a player presents a 1800 rating badge, the viewer's client cryptographically verifies it against the community's public key. **Fake ratings are mathematically impossible.**
- **Verification badge:** Each stat line shows which community signed it and whether the viewer's client successfully verified the signature. A ✅ means "signature valid, community key recognized." A ⚠️ means "signature valid, but community key not in your trusted list." A ❌ means "signature verification failed — possible tampering." This is visible in the detailed stats view, not the compact tooltip (to avoid visual clutter).
- **Inspect credential:** Any SCR-backed number in the profile is clickable. Clicking opens a verification detail panel showing: signing community name + public key fingerprint, SCR sequence number, signature timestamp, raw signed payload (hex-encoded), and verification result. This is the blockchain-style "prove it" button — except it's just Ed25519 signatures, no blockchain needed.

**4. Match History**

Scrollable list of recent matches, each showing:

| Field                     | Source                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Date & time               | Match SCR timestamp                   |
| Map name                  | Match SCR metadata                    |
| Players                   | Match SCR participant list            |
| Result (Win/Loss/Draw)    | Match SCR outcome                     |
| Rating change (+/- delta) | Computed from consecutive rating SCRs |
| Replay link               | Local replay file if available        |

Match history is stored locally (from the player's credential SQLite file). Community servers do not host full match histories — they only issue rating/match SCRs. This is consistent with the local-first principle.

**5. Friends & Social**

IC supports two complementary friend systems:

- **Platform friends (Steam, GOG, etc.):** Retrieved via `PlatformServices::friends_list()`. These are the player's existing social graph — no IC-specific action needed. Platform friends appear in the in-game friends list automatically. Presence information (online, in-game, in-lobby) is synced bidirectionally with the platform.
- **IC friends (community-based):** Players can add friends within a community by mutual friend request. Stored in the local credential file as a bidirectional relationship. Friend list is per-community (friend on Official IC ≠ friend on Clan Wolfpack), but the UI merges all community friends into one unified list with community labels.

```rust
/// Stored in local SQLite — not a signed credential.
/// Friendships are social bookmarks, not reputation data.
pub struct FriendEntry {
    pub player_key: [u8; 32],
    pub display_name: String,         // cached, may be stale
    pub community: CommunityId,       // where the friendship was made
    pub added_at: u64,
    pub notes: Option<String>,        // private label (e.g., "met in tournament")
}
```

**Friends list UI:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Presence states:** Online, In Game, In Lobby, Away, Invisible, Offline. Synced through the community server (lightweight heartbeat), or through `PlatformServices::set_presence()` on Steam/GOG/etc.
- **Join/Spectate/Invite:** One-click actions from the friends list. "Join" puts you in their lobby. "Spec" joins as spectator if the match is in progress and allows it. "Invite" sends a lobby invite.
- **Friend requests:** Mutual-consent only. Player A sends request, Player B accepts or declines. No one-sided "following" (this prevents stalking).
- **Block list:** Blocked players are hidden from the friends list, their chat messages are filtered client-side (see Lobby Communication in D052), and they cannot send friend requests. Blocks are local-only — the blocked player is not notified.
- **Notes:** Private per-friend notes visible only to you. Useful for remembering context ("great teammate", "met at tournament").

**6. Community Memberships**

Players can be members of multiple communities (D052). The profile displays which communities they belong to, with verification badges:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏛️ Communities                                       │
│                                                      │
│  ✅ Official IC Community     Member since 2027-01   │
│     Rating: 1823 (RA1)  |  342 matches               │
│  ✅ Clan Wolfpack             Member since 2027-03   │
│     Rating: 1456 (TD)   |  87 matches                │
│  ✅ RA Competitive League     Member since 2027-06   │
│     Tournament rank: #12                              │
│                                                      │
│  [Join Community...]                                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each community membership is backed by a signed credential — the ✅ badge means the viewer's client verified the SCR signature against the community's public key. This is IC's differentiator: **community memberships are cryptographically proven, not self-claimed.** When viewing another player's profile, you can see exactly which communities vouch for them and their verified standing in each.

**Signed Profile Summary ("proof sheet")**

When viewing another player's full profile, a **Verification Summary** panel shows every community that has signed data for this player, what they've signed, and whether the signatures check out:

```

This panel answers the question: **"Can I trust what this player's profile claims?"** The answer is always cryptographically grounded — not trust-me-bro, not server-side-only, but locally verified Ed25519 signatures against community public keys the viewer explicitly trusts.

**How verification works (viewer-side flow):**

1. Player B presents profile data to Player A.
2. Each SCR-backed field includes the raw SCR (payload + signature + community public key).
3. Player A's client verifies: `Ed25519::verify(community_public_key, payload, signature)`.
4. Player A's client checks: is `community_public_key` in my `trusted_communities` table?
5. If yes → ✅ Verified. If signature valid but community not trusted → ⚠️ Untrusted. If signature invalid → ❌ Failed.
6. All unsigned fields (bio, avatar, display name) are displayed as player-claimed — no verification badge.

This means **every number in the Statistics Card and every badge in Community Memberships is independently verifiable by any viewer** without contacting any server. The verification is offline-capable — if a player has the community's public key cached, they can verify another player's profile on a plane with no internet.

**7. Workshop Creator Profile**

For players who publish mods, maps, or assets to the Workshop (D030/D050), the profile shows a creator section:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔧 Workshop Creator                                  │
│                                                      │
│  Published: 12 resources  |  Total downloads: 8,420  │
│  ★ Featured: alice/hd-sprites (4,200 downloads)      │
│  Latest: alice/desert-nights (uploaded 3 days ago)   │
│                                                      │
│  [View All Publications →]                           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This section appears only for players who have published at least one Workshop resource. Download counts and publication metadata come from the Workshop registry index (D030). Creator tips (D035) link from here.

**8. Custom Profile Elements**

Optional fields that add personality without cluttering the default view:

| Element          | Description                                   | Source                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Favorite Quote   | One-liner (e.g., "Kirov reporting!")          | Player-written, 100 chars max      |
| Favorite Unit    | Displayed with unit portrait from game assets | Player-selected per game module    |
| Replay Highlight | Link to one pinned replay                     | Local replay file                  |
| Social Links     | External URLs (Twitch, YouTube, etc.)         | Player-set, max 3 links            |
| Country Flag     | Optional nationality display                  | Player-selected from ISO 3166 list |

These fields are optional and hidden by default. Players who want a minimal profile show only the identity core and statistics. Players who want a rich social presence can fill in everything.

### Profile Viewing Contexts

The profile appears in different contexts with different levels of detail:

| Context                              | What's shown                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lobby player list**                | Avatar (32×32), display name, rating badge, voice status, ready state                       |
| **Lobby hover tooltip**              | Avatar (64×64), display name, bio (first line), top 3 pinned achievements, rating, win rate |
| **Profile card** (click player name) | Full profile: all sections respecting the viewed player's privacy settings                  |
| **Game browser** (room list)         | Host avatar + name, host rating badge                                                       |
| **In-game sidebar**                  | Player color, display name, faction crest                                                   |
| **Post-game scoreboard**             | Avatar, display name, rating change (+/-), match stats                                      |
| **Friends list**                     | Avatar, display name, presence state, community label                                       |

### Privacy Controls

Every profile section has a visibility setting:

| Visibility Level | Who can see it                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**       | Anyone who encounters your profile (lobby, game browser, post-game) |
| **Friends**      | Only players on your friends list                                   |
| **Community**    | Only players who share at least one community membership with you   |
| **Private**      | Only you                                                            |

Defaults:

| Section                   | Default Visibility                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Display Name              | Public                                  |
| Avatar                    | Public                                  |
| Bio                       | Public                                  |
| Player Title              | Public                                  |
| Faction Crest             | Public                                  |
| Achievement Showcase      | Public                                  |
| Statistics Card           | Public                                  |
| Match History             | Friends                                 |
| Friends List              | Friends                                 |
| Community Memberships     | Public                                  |
| Workshop Creator          | Public                                  |
| Custom Elements           | Friends                                 |
| Behavioral Profile (D042) | **Private (immutable — never exposed)** |

The behavioral profile from D042 (`PlayerStyleProfile`) is **categorically excluded** from the player profile. It's local analytics data for AI training and self-improvement — not social data. This is a hard privacy boundary.

### Profile Storage

Local profile data is stored in the player's SQLite database (D034):

```sql
-- Core profile (locally authoritative)
CREATE TABLE profile (
    player_key      BLOB PRIMARY KEY,  -- own Ed25519 public key
    display_name    TEXT NOT NULL,
    bio             TEXT,
    title           TEXT,
    country_code    TEXT,              -- ISO 3166 alpha-2, nullable
    favorite_quote  TEXT,
    favorite_unit   TEXT,              -- "module:unit_id" format
    created_at      INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at      INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Avatar and banner images (stored as blobs)
CREATE TABLE profile_images (
    image_hash      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- SHA-256 hex
    image_type      TEXT NOT NULL,     -- 'avatar' or 'banner'
    image_data      BLOB NOT NULL,     -- PNG bytes
    width           INTEGER NOT NULL,
    height          INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Profile references (avatar, banner, highlight replay)
CREATE TABLE profile_refs (
    ref_type        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- 'avatar', 'banner', 'highlight_replay'
    ref_value       TEXT NOT NULL      -- image_hash, or replay file path
);

-- Pinned achievements (up to 6)
CREATE TABLE pinned_achievements (
    slot            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (slot BETWEEN 1 AND 6),
    achievement_id  TEXT NOT NULL,     -- references achievements table (D036)
    community_id    BLOB,             -- which community signed it (nullable for local)
    pinned_at       INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Friends list
CREATE TABLE friends (
    player_key      BLOB NOT NULL,
    community_id    BLOB NOT NULL,     -- community where friendship was established
    display_name    TEXT,              -- cached name (may be stale)
    notes           TEXT,
    added_at        INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (player_key, community_id)
);

-- Block list
CREATE TABLE blocked_players (
    player_key      BLOB PRIMARY KEY,
    reason          TEXT,
    blocked_at      INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Privacy settings
CREATE TABLE privacy_settings (
    section         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- 'bio', 'stats', 'match_history', etc.
    visibility      TEXT NOT NULL      -- 'public', 'friends', 'community', 'private'
);

-- Social links (max 3)
CREATE TABLE social_links (
    slot            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (slot BETWEEN 1 AND 3),
    label           TEXT NOT NULL,     -- 'Twitch', 'YouTube', custom
    url             TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Cached profiles of other players (fetched on encounter)
CREATE TABLE cached_profiles (
    player_key      BLOB PRIMARY KEY,
    display_name    TEXT,
    avatar_hash     TEXT,
    bio             TEXT,
    title           TEXT,
    last_seen       INTEGER,          -- timestamp of last encounter
    fetched_at      INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Trusted communities (for profile verification and matchmaking filtering)
CREATE TABLE trusted_communities (
    community_key   BLOB PRIMARY KEY,  -- Ed25519 public key of the community
    community_name  TEXT,              -- cached display name
    community_url   TEXT,              -- cached URL
    auto_trusted    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- 1 if trusted because you're a member
    trusted_at      INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Cached community public keys (learned from encounters, not yet trusted)
CREATE TABLE known_communities (
    community_key   BLOB PRIMARY KEY,
    community_name  TEXT,
    community_url   TEXT,
    first_seen      INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- when we first encountered this key
    last_seen       INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

**Cache eviction:** Cached profiles of other players are evicted LRU after 1000 entries or 30 days since last encounter. Avatar images in `profile_images` are evicted if they're not referenced by own profile or any cached profile.

### Profile Synchronization

Profiles are **not centrally hosted**. Each player owns their profile data locally. When a player enters a lobby or is viewed by another player, profile data is exchanged peer-to-peer (via the relay, same as resource sharing in D052).

**Flow when Player A views Player B's profile:**

1. Player A's client checks `cached_profiles` for Player B's key.
2. If cache miss or stale (>24 hours), request profile from Player B via relay.
3. Player B's client responds with profile data (respecting B's privacy settings — only fields visible to A's access level are included).
4. Player A's client verifies any SCR-backed fields (ratings, achievements, community memberships) against known community public keys.
5. Player A's client caches the profile.
6. If Player B's avatar hash is unknown, Player A requests the avatar image. Cached locally after fetch.

**Bandwidth:** A full profile response is ~2 KB (excluding avatar image). Avatar image is max 64 KB, fetched once and cached. For a typical lobby of 8 players, initial profile loading is ~16 KB text + up to 512 KB avatars — negligible, and avatars are fetched only once per unique player.

### Trusted Communities & Trust-Based Filtering

Players can configure a list of **trusted communities** — the communities whose signed credentials they consider authoritative. This is the trust anchor for everything in the profile system.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
# settings.yaml — communities section
communities:
  joined:
    - name: "Official IC Community"
      url: "https://official.ironcurtain.gg"
      public_key: "ed25519:abc123..."  # cached on first join
    - name: "Clan Wolfpack"
      url: "https://wolfpack.example.com"
      public_key: "ed25519:def456..."
  
  trusted:
    # Communities whose signed credentials you trust for profile verification
    # and matchmaking filtering. You don't need to be a member to trust a community.
    - "ed25519:abc123..."   # Official IC Community
    - "ed25519:def456..."   # Clan Wolfpack
    - "ed25519:789ghi..."   # EU Competitive League (not a member, but trust their ratings)
```

Joined communities are automatically trusted (you trust the community you chose to join). Players can also trust communities they haven't joined — e.g., "I'm not a member of the EU Competitive League, but I trust their ratings as legitimate." Trust is granted by public key, so it survives community renames and URL changes.

**Trust levels displayed in profiles:**

When viewing another player's profile, stats from trusted vs. untrusted communities are visually distinct:

| Badge | Meaning                                            | Display                                           |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | Signature valid + community in your trust list     | Full color, prominent                             |
| ⚠️     | Signature valid + community NOT in your trust list | Dimmed, italic, "Untrusted community" tooltip     |
| ❌     | Signature verification failed                      | Red, strikethrough, "Verification failed" warning |
| —     | No signed data (player-claimed)                    | Gray, no badge                                    |

This lets players immediately distinguish between "1800 rated on a community I trust" and "1800 rated on some random community I've never heard of." The profile doesn't hide untrusted data — it shows it clearly labeled so the viewer can make their own judgment.

**Trust-based matchmaking and lobby filtering:**

Players can require that opponents have verified credentials from their trusted communities. This is configured per-queue and per-room:

```rust
/// Matchmaking preferences — sent to the community server when queuing.
pub struct MatchmakingPreferences {
    pub game_module: GameModuleId,
    pub rating_range: Option<(i32, i32)>,             // min/max rating
    pub require_trusted_profile: TrustRequirement,     // NEW
}

pub enum TrustRequirement {
    /// Match with anyone — no credential check. Default for casual.
    None,
    /// Opponent must have a verified profile from any community
    /// the matchmaking server itself trusts (server-side check).
    AnyCommunityVerified,
    /// Opponent must have a verified profile from at least one of
    /// these specific communities (by public key). Client sends
    /// the list; server filters accordingly.
    SpecificCommunities(Vec<CommunityPublicKey>),
}
```

**How it works in practice:**

- **Casual play (default):** `TrustRequirement::None`. Anyone can join. Profile badges appear but aren't gatekeeping. Maximum player pool, minimum friction.
- **"Verified only" mode:** `TrustRequirement::AnyCommunityVerified`. The matchmaking server checks that the opponent has at least one valid SCR from a community the *server* trusts. This filters out completely anonymous players without requiring specific community membership. Good for semi-competitive play.
- **"Trusted community" mode:** `TrustRequirement::SpecificCommunities([official_ic_key, wolfpack_key])`. The server matches you only with players who have valid SCRs from at least one of those specific communities. This is the strongest filter — effectively "I only play with people vouched for by communities I trust."

**Room-level trust requirements:**

Room hosts can set a trust requirement when creating a room:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Room Settings                                        │
│                                                      │
│  Trust Requirement: [Verified Only ▾]                │
│    ○ Anyone can join (no verification)               │
│    ● Verified profile required                       │
│    ○ Specific communities only:                      │
│      ☑ Official IC Community                         │
│      ☑ Clan Wolfpack                                 │
│      ☐ EU Competitive League                         │
│                                                      │
│  [Create Room]                                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When a player tries to join a room with a trust requirement they don't meet, they see a clear rejection: "This room requires a verified profile from: Official IC Community or Clan Wolfpack. [Join Official IC Community...] [Join Clan Wolfpack...]"

**Game browser filtering:**

The game browser (Tier 3 in D052) gains a trust filter column:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Game Browser                                              [Refresh]   │
├──────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────┬──────┬───────────────┬─────────────┤
│ Room     │ Host │ Players │ Map    │ Ping │ Trust         │ Mods        │
├──────────┼──────┼─────────┼────────┼──────┼───────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Ranked   │ cmdr │ 1/2     │ Arena  │ 23ms │ ✅ Official   │ none        │
│ HD Game  │ alice│ 3/4     │ Europe │ 45ms │ ⚠️ Any verified│ hd-pack 2.1 │
│ Open     │ bob  │ 2/6     │ Desert │ 67ms │ 🔓 Anyone     │ none        │
└──────────┴──────┴─────────┴────────┴──────┴───────────────┴─────────────┘
│  Filter: [☑ Show only rooms I can join]  [☑ Show trusted communities]   │
```

The `Show only rooms I can join` filter hides rooms whose trust requirements you don't meet — so you don't see rooms you'll be rejected from. The `Show trusted communities` filter shows only rooms hosted on communities in your trust list.

**Why this matters:**

This solves the smurf/alt-account problem that plagues every competitive game. A player can't create a fresh anonymous account and grief ranked lobbies — the room requires verified credentials from a trusted community, which means they need a real history of matches. It also solves the fake-rating problem: you can't claim to be 1800 unless a community you trust has signed an SCR proving it.

But it's **not authoritarian**. Players who want casual, open, unverified games can play freely. Trust requirements are opt-in per-room and per-matchmaking-queue. The default is open. The tools are there for communities that want stronger verification — they're not forced on anyone.

**Anti-abuse considerations:**

- **Community collusion:** A bad actor could create a community, sign fake credentials, and present them. But no one else would trust that community's key. Trust is explicitly granted by each player. This is a feature, not a bug — it's exactly how PGP/GPG web-of-trust works, minus the key-signing parties.
- **Community ban evasion:** If a player is banned from a community (D052 revocation), their SCRs from that community become unverifiable. They can't present banned credentials. They'd need to join a different community and rebuild reputation from scratch.
- **Privacy:** The trust requirement reveals which communities a player is a member of (since they must present SCRs). Players uncomfortable with this can stick to `TrustRequirement::None` rooms. The privacy controls from D053 still apply — you choose which community memberships are visible on your profile, but if a room *requires* membership proof, you must present it to join.

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D034 (SQLite):** Profile storage is SQLite. Cached profiles, friends, block lists — all local SQLite tables.
- **D036 (Achievements):** Pinned achievements on the profile reference D036 achievement records. Achievement verification uses D052 SCRs.
- **D042 (Behavioral Profiles):** Categorically separate. D042 is local AI training data. D053 is social-facing identity. They never merge. This is a hard privacy boundary.
- **D046 (Premium Content):** Cosmetic purchases (if any) are displayed in the profile (e.g., custom profile borders, title unlocks). But the core profile is always free and full-featured.
- **D050 (Workshop):** Workshop creator statistics feed the creator profile section.
- **D052 (Community Servers & SCR):** The verification backbone. Every reputation claim in the profile (rating, achievements, community membership) is backed by a signed credential. D053 is the user-facing layer; D052 is the cryptographic foundation. Trusted Communities (D053) determine which SCR issuers the player considers authoritative — this feeds into profile display, lobby filtering, and matchmaking preferences.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Central profile server** (rejected — contradicts federation model, creates single point of failure, requires infrastructure IC doesn't want to operate)
- **Blockchain-based identity** (rejected — massively overcomplicated, no user benefit over Ed25519 SCR, environmental concerns)
- **Rich profile customization (themes, animations, music)** (deferred — too much scope for initial implementation. May be added as Workshop cosmetic packs in Phase 6+)
- **Full social network features (posts, feeds, groups)** (rejected — out of scope. IC is a game, not a social network. Communities, friends, and profiles are sufficient. Players who want social features use Discord)
- **Mandatory real name / identity verification** (rejected — privacy violation, hostile to the gaming community's norms, not IC's business)

### Phase

- **Phase 3:** Basic profile (display name, avatar, bio, local storage, lobby display). Friends list (platform-backed via `PlatformServices`).
- **Phase 5:** Community-backed profiles (SCR-verified ratings, achievements, memberships). IC friends (community-based mutual friend requests). Presence system. Profile cards in lobby. Trusted communities configuration. Trust-based matchmaking filtering. Profile verification UI (signed proof sheet). Game browser trust filters.
- **Phase 6a:** Workshop creator profiles. Full achievement showcase. Custom profile elements. Privacy controls UI. Profile viewing in game browser. Cross-community trust discovery.

### Problem

The engine already trait-abstracts 23 subsystems (D041 inventory) and data-drives 7 more through YAML/Lua. But an architecture switchability audit identified three remaining subsystems where the *implementation* is hardcoded below an existing abstraction layer, creating risks that are cheap to mitigate now but expensive to fix later:

1. **Transport layer** — `NetworkModel` abstracts the logical protocol (lockstep vs. rollback) but not the transport beneath it. Raw UDP is hardcoded. WASM builds cannot use raw UDP sockets at all — browser multiplayer is blocked until this is abstracted. WebTransport and QUIC are maturing rapidly and may supersede raw UDP for game transport within the engine's lifetime.

2. **Cryptographic signature scheme** — Ed25519 is hardcoded in ~15 callsites across the codebase: SCR records (D052), replay signature chains, Workshop index signing, `CertifiedMatchResult`, key rotation records, and community identity. Ed25519 is excellent today (128-bit security, fast, compact), but NIST's post-quantum transition timeline (ML-DSA standardized 2024, recommended migration by ~2035) means the engine may need to swap signature algorithms without breaking every signed record in existence.

3. **Snapshot serialization codec** — `SimSnapshot` is serialized with bincode + LZ4, hardcoded in the save/load path. Bincode is not self-describing — schema changes (adding a field, reordering an enum) silently produce corrupt deserialization rather than a clean error. Cross-version save compatibility requires codec-version awareness that doesn't currently exist.

Each uses the right abstraction mechanism for its specific situation: **Transport** gets a trait (open-ended, third-party implementations expected, hot path where monomorphization matters), **SignatureScheme** gets an enum (closed set of 2–3 algorithms, runtime dispatch needed for mixed-version verification), and **SnapshotCodec** gets version-tagged dispatch (internal versioning, no pluggability needed). The total cost is ~80 lines of definitions. The benefit is that none of these becomes a rewrite-required bottleneck when reality changes.

### The Principle (from D041)

Abstract the *transport mechanism*, not the *data*. If the concern is "which bytes go over which wire" or "which algorithm signs these bytes" or "which codec serializes this struct" — that's a mechanism that can change independently of the logic above it. The logic (lockstep protocol, credential verification, snapshot semantics) stays identical regardless of which mechanism implements it.

### 1. `Transport` — Network Transport Abstraction

**Risk level: HIGH.** Browser multiplayer (Invariant #10: platform-agnostic) is blocked without this. WASM cannot open raw UDP sockets — it's a platform API limitation, not a library gap. Every browser RTS (Chrono Divide, OpenRA-web experiments) solves this by abstracting transport. We already abstract the protocol layer (`NetworkModel`); failing to abstract the transport layer below it is an inconsistency.

**Current state:** The connection establishment flow in `03-NETCODE.md` shows transport as a concern "below" `NetworkModel`:

```
Discovery → Connection establishment → NetworkModel constructed → Game loop
```

But connection establishment hardcodes UDP. A `Transport` trait makes this explicit.

**Trait definition:**

```rust
/// Abstracts a single bidirectional network channel beneath NetworkModel.
/// Each Transport instance represents ONE connection (to a relay, or to a
/// single peer in P2P). NetworkModel manages multiple Transport instances
/// for multi-peer P2P; relay mode uses a single Transport to the relay.
///
/// Lives in ic-net. NetworkModel implementations are generic over Transport.
///
/// Design: point-to-point, not connectionless. No endpoint parameter in
/// send/recv — the Transport IS the connection. For UDP, this maps to a
/// connected socket (UdpSocket::connect()). For WebSocket/QUIC, this is
/// the natural model. Multi-peer routing is NetworkModel's concern.
///
/// All transports expose datagram/message semantics. The protocol layer
/// (NetworkModel) always runs its own reliability and ordering — sequence
/// numbers, retransmission, frame resend (§ Frame Data Resilience). On
/// reliable transports (WebSocket), these mechanisms become no-ops at
/// runtime (retransmit timers never fire). This eliminates conditional
/// branches in NetworkModel and keeps a single code path and test matrix.
pub trait Transport: Send + Sync {
    /// Send a datagram/message to the connected peer. Non-blocking or
    /// returns WouldBlock. Data is a complete message (not a byte stream).
    fn send(&self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), TransportError>;

    /// Receive the next available message, if any. Non-blocking.
    /// Returns the number of bytes written to `buf`, or None if no
    /// message is available.
    fn recv(&self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<Option<usize>, TransportError>;

    /// Maximum payload size for a single send() call.
    /// UdpTransport returns ~476 (MTU-safe). WebSocketTransport returns ~64KB.
    fn max_payload(&self) -> usize;

    /// Establish the connection to the target endpoint.
    fn connect(&mut self, target: &Endpoint) -> Result<(), TransportError>;

    /// Tear down the connection.
    fn disconnect(&mut self);
}
```

**Default implementations:**

| Implementation       | Backing                               | Platform         | Phase  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UdpTransport`       | `std::net::UdpSocket`                 | Desktop, Server  | 5      | Default. Raw UDP, MTU-aware, same as current hardcoded behavior.                                                                                                                                   |
| `WebSocketTransport` | `tungstenite` / browser WebSocket API | WASM, Fallback   | 5      | Enables browser multiplayer. Reliable + ordered (NetworkModel's retransmit logic becomes a no-op — single code path, zero conditional branches). Higher latency than UDP but functional.           |
| `WebTransportImpl`   | WebTransport API                      | WASM (future)    | Future | Unreliable datagrams over QUIC. Best of both worlds — UDP-like semantics in the browser. Spec still maturing (W3C Working Draft).                                                                  |
| `QuicTransport`      | `quinn`                               | Desktop (future) | Future | Stream multiplexing, built-in encryption, 0-RTT reconnects. Candidate to replace raw UDP + custom reliability when QUIC ecosystem matures.                                                         |
| `MemoryTransport`    | `crossbeam` channel                   | Testing          | 2      | Zero-latency, zero-loss in-process transport. Already implied by `LocalNetwork` — this makes it explicit as a `Transport`. NetworkModel manages a `Vec<T>` of these for multi-peer test scenarios. |

**Relationship to `NetworkModel`:**

```rust
/// NetworkModel becomes generic over Transport.
/// Existing code that constructs LockstepNetwork or RelayLockstepNetwork
/// now specifies a Transport. For desktop builds, this is UdpTransport.
/// For WASM builds, this is WebSocketTransport.
///
/// Relay mode: single Transport to the relay server.
/// P2P mode: Vec<T> — one Transport per peer connection.
pub struct LockstepNetwork<T: Transport> {
    transport: T,       // relay mode: connection to relay
    // ... existing fields unchanged
}

pub struct P2PLockstepNetwork<T: Transport> {
    peers: Vec<T>,      // one connection per peer
    // ... existing fields unchanged
}

impl<T: Transport> NetworkModel for LockstepNetwork<T> {
    // All existing logic unchanged. send()/recv() calls go through
    // self.transport instead of directly calling UdpSocket methods.
    // Reliability layer (sequence numbers, retransmit, frame resend)
    // runs identically regardless of transport — on reliable transports,
    // retransmit timers simply never fire.
}
```

**What does NOT change:** The wire format (delta-compressed TLV), the `OrderCodec` trait, the `NetworkModel` trait API, connection discovery (join codes, tracking servers), or the relay server protocol. Transport is purely "how bytes move," not "what bytes mean."

**Why no `is_reliable()` method?** Adding reliability awareness to `Transport` would create conditional branches in `NetworkModel` — one code path for unreliable transports (full retransmit logic) and another for reliable ones (skip retransmit). This doubles the test matrix and creates subtle behavioral differences between deployment targets. Instead, `NetworkModel` always runs its full reliability layer. On reliable transports (WebSocket), retransmit timers never fire and the redundancy costs nothing at runtime. One code path, one test matrix, zero conditional complexity. This is the same approach used by ENet, Valve's GameNetworkingSockets, and most serious game networking libraries.

**Message lanes (from GNS):** `NetworkModel` multiplexes multiple logical streams (lanes) over a single `Transport` connection — each with independent priority and weight. Lanes are a protocol-layer concern, not a transport-layer concern: `Transport` provides raw byte delivery; `NetworkModel` handles lane scheduling, priority draining, and per-lane buffering. See `03-NETCODE.md` § Message Lanes for the lane definitions (`Orders`, `Control`, `Chat`, `Voice`, `Bulk`) and scheduling policy. The lane system ensures time-critical orders are never delayed by chat traffic, voice data, or bulk data — a pattern validated by GNS's configurable lane architecture (see `research/valve-github-analysis.md` § 1.4). The `Voice` lane (D059) carries relay-forwarded Opus VoIP frames as unreliable, best-effort traffic.

**Transport encryption (from GNS):** All multiplayer transports are encrypted with AES-256-GCM over an X25519 key exchange — the same cryptographic suite used by Valve's GameNetworkingSockets and DTLS 1.3. Encryption sits between `Transport` and `NetworkModel`, transparent to both layers. Each connection generates an ephemeral Curve25519 keypair for forward secrecy; the symmetric key is never reused across sessions. After key exchange, the handshake is signed with the player's Ed25519 identity key (D052) to bind the encrypted channel to a verified identity. The GCM nonce incorporates the packet sequence number, preventing replay attacks. See `03-NETCODE.md` § Transport Encryption for the full specification and `06-SECURITY.md` for the threat model. `MemoryTransport` (testing) and `LocalNetwork` (single-player) skip encryption.

**Pluggable signaling (from GNS):** Connection establishment is further decomposed into a `Signaling` trait — abstracting how peers exchange connection metadata (IP addresses, relay tokens, ICE candidates) before the `Transport` is established. This follows GNS's `ISteamNetworkingConnectionSignaling` pattern. Different deployment contexts use different signaling: relay-brokered, rendezvous + hole-punch, direct IP, or WebRTC for browser builds. Adding a new connection method (e.g., Steamworks P2P, Epic Online Services) requires only a new `Signaling` implementation — no changes to `Transport` or `NetworkModel`. See `03-NETCODE.md` § Pluggable Signaling for trait definition and implementations.

**Why not abstract this earlier (D006/D041)?** At D006 design time, browser multiplayer was a distant future target and raw UDP was the obvious choice. Invariant #10 (platform-agnostic) was added later, making the gap visible. D041 explicitly listed the transport layer in its inventory of *already-abstracted* concerns via `NetworkModel` — but `NetworkModel` abstracts the protocol, not the transport. This decision corrects that conflation.

### 2. `SignatureScheme` — Cryptographic Algorithm Abstraction

**Risk level: HIGH.** Ed25519 is hardcoded in ~15 callsites. NIST standardized ML-DSA (post-quantum signatures) in 2024 and recommends migration by ~2035. The engine's 10+ year lifespan means a signature algorithm swap is probable, not speculative. More immediately: different deployment contexts may want different algorithms (Ed448 for higher security margin, ML-DSA-65 for post-quantum compliance).

**Current state:** D052's SCR format deliberately has "No algorithm field. Always Ed25519." — this was the right call to prevent JWT's algorithm confusion vulnerability (CVE-2015-9235). But the solution isn't "hardcode one algorithm forever" — it's "the version field implies the algorithm, and the verifier looks up the algorithm from the version, never from attacker-controlled input."

**Why enum dispatch, not a trait?** The set of signature algorithms is small and closed — realistically 2–3 over the engine's entire lifetime (Ed25519 now, ML-DSA-65 later, possibly one more). This makes it fundamentally different from `Transport` (which is open-ended — anyone can write a new transport). A trait would introduce design tension: associated types (`PublicKey`, `SecretKey`, `Signature`) are not object-safe with `Clone`, meaning `dyn SignatureScheme` won't compile. But runtime dispatch is *required* — a player's credential file contains mixed-version SCRs (version 1 Ed25519 alongside future version 2 ML-DSA), and the verifier must handle both in the same loop. Workarounds exist (erase types to `Vec<u8>`, or drop `Clone`) but they sacrifice type safety that was the supposed benefit of the trait.

Enum dispatch resolves all of these tensions: exhaustive `match` with no default arm (compiler catches missing variants), `Clone`/`Copy` for free, zero vtable overhead, and idiomatic Rust for small closed sets. Adding a third algorithm someday means adding one enum variant — the compiler then flags every callsite that needs updating.

**Enum definition:**

```rust
/// Signature algorithm selection for all signed records.
/// Lives in ic-net (signing + verification are I/O concerns; ic-sim
/// never signs or verifies anything — Invariant #1).
///
/// NOT a trait. The algorithm set is small and closed (2–3 variants
/// over the engine's lifetime). Enum dispatch gives:
/// - Exhaustive match (compiler catches missing variants on addition)
/// - Clone/Copy for free
/// - Zero vtable overhead
/// - Runtime dispatch without object-safety headaches
///
/// Third-party signature algorithms are out of scope — cryptographic
/// agility is a security risk (see JWT CVE-2015-9235). The engine
/// controls which algorithms it trusts.
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum SignatureScheme {
    Ed25519,
    // MlDsa65,  // future: post-quantum (NIST FIPS 204)
}

impl SignatureScheme {
    /// Sign a message. Returns the signature bytes.
    pub fn sign(&self, sk: &[u8], msg: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
        match self {
            Self::Ed25519 => ed25519_sign(sk, msg),
            // Self::MlDsa65 => ml_dsa_65_sign(sk, msg),
        }
    }

    /// Verify a signature against a public key and message.
    pub fn verify(&self, pk: &[u8], msg: &[u8], sig: &[u8]) -> bool {
        match self {
            Self::Ed25519 => ed25519_verify(pk, msg, sig),
            // Self::MlDsa65 => ml_dsa_65_verify(pk, msg, sig),
        }
    }

    /// Generate a new keypair. Returns (public_key, secret_key).
    pub fn generate_keypair(&self) -> (Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>) {
        match self {
            Self::Ed25519 => ed25519_generate_keypair(),
            // Self::MlDsa65 => ml_dsa_65_generate_keypair(),
        }
    }

    /// Public key size in bytes. Determines SCR binary format layout.
    pub fn public_key_len(&self) -> usize {
        match self {
            Self::Ed25519 => 32,
            // Self::MlDsa65 => 1952,
        }
    }

    /// Signature size in bytes. Determines SCR binary format layout.
    pub fn signature_len(&self) -> usize {
        match self {
            Self::Ed25519 => 64,
            // Self::MlDsa65 => 3309,
        }
    }
}
```

**Algorithm variants:**

| Variant   | Algorithm | Key Size   | Sig Size   | Phase  | Notes                                                                      |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ed25519` | Ed25519   | 32 bytes   | 64 bytes   | 5      | Default. Current behavior. 128-bit security. Fast, compact, battle-tested. |
| `MlDsa65` | ML-DSA-65 | 1952 bytes | 3309 bytes | Future | Post-quantum. NIST FIPS 204. Larger keys/sigs but quantum-resistant.       |

**Version-implies-algorithm (preserving D052's anti-confusion guarantee):**

D052's SCR format already has a `version` byte (currently `0x01`). The version-to-algorithm mapping is hardcoded in the *verifier*, never read from the record itself:

```rust
/// Version → SignatureScheme mapping.
/// This is the verifier's lookup table, NOT a field in the signed record.
/// Preserves D052's guarantee: no algorithm negotiation, no attacker-controlled
/// algorithm selection. The version byte is set by the issuer at signing time;
/// the verifier uses it to select the correct verification algorithm.
///
/// Returns Result, not panic — version bytes come from user-provided files
/// (credential stores, replays, save files) and must fail gracefully.
fn scheme_for_version(version: u8) -> Result<SignatureScheme, CredentialError> {
    match version {
        0x01 => Ok(SignatureScheme::Ed25519),
        // 0x02 => Ok(SignatureScheme::MlDsa65),
        _ => Err(CredentialError::UnknownVersion(version)),
    }
}
```

**What changes in the SCR binary format:** Nothing structurally. The `version` byte already exists. What changes is the *interpretation*:

- **Before (D052):** "Version is for format evolution. Algorithm is always Ed25519."
- **After (D054):** "Version implies both format layout AND algorithm. Version 1 = Ed25519 (32-byte keys, 64-byte sigs). Version 2 = ML-DSA-65 (1952-byte keys, 3309-byte sigs). The verifier dispatches on version, never on an attacker-controlled field."

The variable-length fields (`community_key`, `player_key`, `signature`) are already length-implied by `version` — version 1 readers know key=32, sig=64. Version 2 readers know key=1952, sig=3309. No length prefix needed because the version fully determines the layout.

**Backward compatibility:** A version 1 SCR issued by a community running Ed25519 remains valid forever. A community migrating to ML-DSA-65 issues version 2 SCRs. Both can coexist in a player's credential file. Version 1 SCRs don't expire or become invalid — they just can't be *newly issued* once the community upgrades.

**Affected callsites (all change from direct `ed25519_dalek` calls to `SignatureScheme` enum method calls):**

- SCR record signing/verification (D052 — community servers + client)
- Replay signature chain (`TickSignature` in `05-FORMATS.md`)
- Workshop index signing (D049 — CI signing pipeline)
- `CertifiedMatchResult` (D052 — relay server)
- Key rotation records (D052 — community servers)
- Player identity keypairs (D052/D053)

**Why not a `version` field in each signature?** Because that's exactly JWT's `alg` header vulnerability. The version lives in the *container* (SCR record header, replay file header, Workshop index header) — not in the signature itself. The container's version is written by the issuer and verified structurally (known offset, not parsed from attacker-controlled payload). This is the same defense D052 already uses; D054 just extends it to support future algorithms.

### 3. `SnapshotCodec` — Save/Replay Serialization Versioning

**Risk level: MEDIUM.** Bincode is fast and compact but not self-describing — if any field in `SimSnapshot` is added, removed, or reordered, deserialization silently produces garbage or panics. The save format header already has a `version: u16` field (`05-FORMATS.md`), but no code dispatches on it. Today, version is always 1 and the codec is always bincode + LZ4. This works until the first schema change — which is inevitable as the sim evolves through Phase 2–7.

**This is NOT a trait in `ic-sim`.** Snapshot serialization is I/O — it belongs in `ic-game` (save/load) and `ic-net` (snapshot transfer for late-join). The sim produces/consumes `SimSnapshot` as an in-memory struct. How that struct becomes bytes is the codec's concern.

**Codec dispatch (version → codec):**

```rust
/// Version-to-codec dispatch for SimSnapshot serialization.
/// Lives in ic-game (save/load path) and ic-net (snapshot transfer).
///
/// NOT a trait — there's no pluggability need here. Game modules don't
/// provide custom codecs. This is internal versioning, not extensibility.
/// A match statement is simpler, more explicit, and easier to audit than
/// a trait registry.
pub fn encode_snapshot(
    snapshot: &SimSnapshot,
    version: u16,
) -> Result<Vec<u8>, CodecError> {
    let serialized = match version {
        1 => bincode::serialize(snapshot)
            .map_err(|e| CodecError::Serialize(e.to_string()))?,
        2 => postcard::to_allocvec(snapshot)
            .map_err(|e| CodecError::Serialize(e.to_string()))?,
        _ => return Err(CodecError::UnknownVersion(version)),
    };
    Ok(lz4_flex::compress_prepend_size(&serialized))
}

pub fn decode_snapshot(
    data: &[u8],
    version: u16,
) -> Result<SimSnapshot, CodecError> {
    let decompressed = lz4_flex::decompress_size_prepended(data)
        .map_err(|e| CodecError::Decompress(e.to_string()))?;
    match version {
        1 => bincode::deserialize(&decompressed)
            .map_err(|e| CodecError::Deserialize(e.to_string())),
        2 => postcard::from_bytes(&decompressed)
            .map_err(|e| CodecError::Deserialize(e.to_string())),
        _ => Err(CodecError::UnknownVersion(version)),
    }
}

/// Errors from snapshot/replay codec operations. Surfaced in UI as
/// "incompatible save file" or "corrupted replay" — never a panic.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum CodecError {
    UnknownVersion(u16),
    Serialize(String),
    Deserialize(String),
    Decompress(String),
}
```

**Why postcard as the likely version 2?**

The version 1 → 2 migration path: saves with version 1 headers decode via bincode. New saves write version 2 headers and encode via postcard. Old saves remain loadable forever. The `SimSnapshot` struct itself doesn't change — only the codec that serializes it.

**Migration strategy (from Factorio + DFU analysis):** Mojang's DataFixerUpper uses algebraic optics (profunctor-based type-safe transformations) for Minecraft save migration — academically elegant but massively over-engineered for practical use (see `research/mojang-wube-modding-analysis.md`). Factorio's two-tier migration system is the better model: (1) **Declarative renames** — a YAML mapping of `old_field_name → new_field_name` per category, applied automatically by version number, and (2) **Lua migration scripts** — for complex structural transformations that can't be expressed as simple renames. Scripts are ordered by version and applied sequentially. This avoids DFU's complexity while handling real-world schema evolution. Additionally, every IC YAML rule file should include a `format_version` field (e.g., `format_version: "1.0.0"`) — following the pattern used by both Minecraft Bedrock (`"format_version": "1.26.0"` in every JSON entity file) and Factorio (`"factorio_version": "2.0"` in `info.json`). This enables the migration system to detect and transform old formats without guessing.

**Why NOT a trait?** Unlike Transport and SignatureScheme, snapshot codecs have zero pluggability requirement. No game module, mod, or community server needs to provide a custom snapshot serializer. This is purely internal version dispatch — a `match` statement is the right abstraction, not a trait. D041's principle: "abstract the *algorithm*, not the *data*." Snapshot serialization is data marshaling with no algorithmic variation — the right tool is version-tagged dispatch, not trait polymorphism.

**Relationship to replay format:** The replay file format (`05-FORMATS.md`) also has a `version: u16` in its header. The same version-to-codec dispatch applies to replay tick frames (`ReplayTickFrame` serialization). Replay version 1 uses bincode + LZ4 block compression. A future version 2 could use postcard + LZ4. The replay header version and the save header version evolve independently — a replay viewer doesn't need to understand save files and vice versa.

### What Still Does NOT Need Abstraction

This audit explicitly confirmed that the following remain correctly un-abstracted (extending D041's "What Does NOT Need a Trait" table):

| Subsystem                  | Why No Abstraction Needed                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| YAML parser (`serde_yaml`) | Parser crate is a Cargo dependency swap — no trait needed, no code change beyond `Cargo.toml`.                                    |
| Lua runtime (`mlua`)       | Deeply integrated via `ic-script`. Switching Lua impls is a rewrite regardless of traits. The scripting *API* is the abstraction. |
| WASM runtime (`wasmtime`)  | Same — the WASM API is the abstraction, not the runtime binary.                                                                   |
| Compression (LZ4)          | Used in exactly two places (snapshot, replay). Swapping is a one-line change. No trait overhead justified.                        |
| Bevy                       | The engine framework. Abstracting Bevy is abstracting gravity. If Bevy is replaced, everything is rewritten.                      |
| State hash algorithm       | SHA-256 Merkle tree. Changing this requires coordinated protocol version bump across all clients — a trait wouldn't help.         |
| RNG (`DeterministicRng`)   | Already deterministic and internal to `ic-sim`. Swapping PRNG algorithms is a single-struct replacement. No polymorphism needed.  |

### Alternatives Considered

- **Abstract everything now** (rejected — violates D015's "no speculative abstractions"; the 7 items above don't carry meaningful regret risk)
- **Abstract nothing, handle it later** (rejected — Transport blocks WASM multiplayer *now*; SignatureScheme's 15 hardcoded callsites grow with every feature; SnapshotCodec's first schema change will force an emergency versioning retrofit)
- **Use `dyn` trait objects instead of generics for Transport** (rejected — `dyn Transport` adds vtable overhead on every `send()`/`recv()` in the hot network path; monomorphized generics are zero-cost. `Transport` is used in tight loops — static dispatch is correct here)
- **Make SignatureScheme a trait with associated types** (rejected — associated types are not object-safe with `Clone`, but runtime dispatch is required for mixed-version SCR verification. Erasing types to `Vec<u8>` sacrifices the type safety that was the supposed benefit. Enum dispatch gives exhaustive match, `Clone`/`Copy`, zero vtable, and compiler-enforced completeness when adding variants)
- **Make SignatureScheme a trait with `&[u8]` params (object-safe)** (rejected — works technically, but the algorithm set is small and closed. A trait implies open extensibility; the engine deliberately controls which algorithms it trusts. Enum is the idiomatic Rust pattern for closed dispatch)
- **Add algorithm negotiation to SCR** (rejected — this IS JWT's `alg` header. Version-implies-algorithm is strictly safer and already fits D052's format)
- **Use protobuf/flatbuffers for snapshot serialization** (rejected — adds external IDL dependency, `.proto` file maintenance, code generation step. Postcard gives schema stability within the `serde` ecosystem IC already uses)
- **Make SnapshotCodec a trait** (rejected — no pluggability requirement exists. A `match` statement is simpler and more auditable than a trait registry for internal version dispatch)
- **Add `is_reliable()` to Transport** (rejected — would create conditional branches in NetworkModel: one code path for unreliable transports with full retransmit, another for reliable transports that skips it. Doubles the test matrix. Instead, NetworkModel always runs its reliability layer; on reliable transports the retransmit timers simply never fire. Zero runtime cost, one code path)
- **Connectionless (endpoint-addressed) Transport API** (rejected — creates impedance mismatch: UDP is connectionless but WebSocket/QUIC are connection-oriented. Point-to-point model fits all transports naturally. For UDP, use connected sockets. Multi-peer routing is NetworkModel's concern, not Transport's)

### Relationship to Existing Decisions

- **D006 (NetworkModel):** `Transport` lives below `NetworkModel`. The connection establishment flow becomes: Discovery → Transport::connect() → NetworkModel constructed over Transport → Game loop. `NetworkModel` gains a `T: Transport` type parameter.
- **D010 (Snapshottable sim):** Snapshot encoding/decoding is the I/O layer around D010's `SimSnapshot`. D010 defines the struct; D054 defines how it becomes bytes.
- **D041 (Trait-abstracted subsystems):** `Transport` is added to D041's inventory table. `SignatureScheme` uses enum dispatch (not a trait) — it belongs in the "closed set" category alongside `SnapshotCodec`'s version dispatch. Both are version-tagged, exhaustive, and compiler-enforced. Neither needs the open extensibility that traits provide.
- **D052 (Community Servers & SCR):** The `version` byte in SCR format now implies the signature algorithm. D052's anti-algorithm-confusion guarantee is preserved — the defense shifts from "hardcode one algorithm" to "version determines algorithm, verifier never reads algorithm from attacker input."
- **Invariant #10 (Platform-agnostic):** `Transport` trait directly enables WASM multiplayer, the primary platform gap.

### Phase

- **Phase 2:** `MemoryTransport` for testing (already implied by `LocalNetwork`; making it explicit as a `Transport`). `SnapshotCodec` version dispatch (v1 = bincode + LZ4, matching current behavior).
- **Phase 5:** `UdpTransport`, `WebSocketTransport` (matching current hardcoded behavior — the trait boundary exists, the implementation is unchanged). `SignatureScheme::Ed25519` enum variant wired into all D052 SCR code, replacing direct `ed25519_dalek` calls.
- **Future:** `WebTransportImpl` (when spec stabilizes), `QuicTransport` (when ecosystem matures), `SignatureScheme::MlDsa65` variant (when post-quantum migration timeline firms up), `SnapshotCodec` v2 (postcard, when first `SimSnapshot` schema change occurs).

## D055: Ranked Tiers, Seasons & Matchmaking Queue

**Status:** Settled
**Phase:** Phase 5 (Multiplayer & Competitive)
**Depends on:** D041 (RankingProvider), D052 (Community Servers), D053 (Player Profile), D037 (Competitive Governance), D034 (SQLite Storage), D019 (Balance Presets)

### Problem

The existing competitive infrastructure (D041's `RankingProvider`, D052's signed credentials, D053's profile) provides the *foundational layer* — a pluggable rating algorithm, cryptographic verification, and display system. But it doesn't define the *player-facing competitive experience*:

1. **No rank tiers.** `display_rating()` outputs "1500 ± 200" — useful for analytically-minded players but lacking the motivational milestones that named ranks provide. CS2's transition from hidden MMR to visible CS Rating (with color bands) was universally praised but showed that even visible numbers benefit from tier mapping for casual engagement. SC2's league system proved this for RTS specifically.
2. **No season structure.** Without seasons, leaderboards stagnate — top players stop playing and retain positions indefinitely, exactly the problem C&C Remastered experienced (see `research/ranked-matchmaking-analysis.md` § 3.3).
3. **No placement flow.** D041 defines new-player seeding formula but doesn't specify the user-facing placement match experience.
4. **No small-population matchmaking degradation.** RTS communities are 10–100× smaller than FPS/MOBA populations. The matchmaking queue must handle 100-player populations gracefully, not just 100,000-player populations.
5. **No faction-specific rating.** IC has asymmetric factions. A player who is strong with Allies may be weak with Soviets — one rating doesn't capture this.
6. **No map selection for ranked.** Competitive map pool curation is mentioned in Phase 5 and D037 but the in-queue selection mechanism (veto/ban) isn't defined.

### Solution

#### Tier Configuration (YAML-Driven, Per Game Module)

Rank tier names, thresholds, and visual assets are defined in the game module's YAML configuration — not in engine code. The engine provides the tier resolution logic; the game module provides the theme.

```yaml
# ra/rules/ranked-tiers.yaml
# Red Alert game module — Cold War military rank theme
ranked_tiers:
  format_version: "1.0.0"
  divisions_per_tier: 3          # III → II → I within each tier
  division_labels: ["III", "II", "I"]  # lowest to highest

  tiers:
    - name: Cadet
      min_rating: 0
      icon: "icons/ranks/cadet.png"
      color: "#8B7355"            # Brown — officer trainee

    - name: Lieutenant
      min_rating: 1000
      icon: "icons/ranks/lieutenant.png"
      color: "#A0A0A0"            # Silver-grey — junior officer

    - name: Captain
      min_rating: 1250
      icon: "icons/ranks/captain.png"
      color: "#FFD700"            # Gold — company commander

    - name: Major
      min_rating: 1425
      icon: "icons/ranks/major.png"
      color: "#4169E1"            # Royal blue — battalion level

    - name: Lt. Colonel
      min_rating: 1575
      icon: "icons/ranks/lt_colonel.png"
      color: "#9370DB"            # Purple — senior field officer

    - name: Colonel
      min_rating: 1750
      icon: "icons/ranks/colonel.png"
      color: "#DC143C"            # Crimson — regimental command

    - name: Brigadier
      min_rating: 1975
      icon: "icons/ranks/brigadier.png"
      color: "#FF4500"            # Red-orange — brigade command

  elite_tiers:
    - name: General
      min_rating: 2250
      icon: "icons/ranks/general.png"
      color: "#FFD700"            # Gold — general staff
      show_rating: true           # Display actual rating number alongside tier

    - name: Supreme Commander
      type: top_n                 # Fixed top-N, not rating threshold
      count: 200                  # Top 200 players per community server
      icon: "icons/ranks/supreme-commander.png"
      color: "#FFFFFF"            # White/platinum — pinnacle
      show_rating: true
      show_leaderboard_position: true
```

**Why military ranks for Red Alert:**
- Players command armies — military rank progression IS the core fantasy
- All ranks are officer-grade (Cadet through General) because the player is always commanding, never a foot soldier
- Proper military hierarchy — every rank is real and in correct sequential order: Cadet → Lieutenant → Captain → Major → Lt. Colonel → Colonel → Brigadier → General
- "Supreme Commander" crowns the hierarchy — a title earned, not a rank given. It carries the weight of Cold War authority (STAVKA, NATO Supreme Allied Commander) and the unmistakable identity of the RTS genre itself

**Why 7 + 2 = 9 tiers (23 ranked positions):**
- SC2 proved 7+2 works for RTS community sizes (~100K peak, ~10K sustained)
- Fewer than LoL's 10 tiers (designed for 100M+ players — IC won't have that)
- More than AoE4's 6 tiers (too few for meaningful progression)
- 3 divisions per tier (matching SC2/AoE4/Valorant convention) provides intra-tier goals
- Lt. Colonel fills the gap between Major and Colonel — the most natural compound rank, universally understood
- Elite tiers (General, Supreme Commander) create aspirational targets even with small populations

**Game-module replaceability:** Tiberian Dawn could use GDI/Nod themed rank names. A fantasy RTS mod can define completely different tier sets. Community mods define their own via YAML. The engine resolves `PlayerRating.rating → tier name + division` using whatever tier configuration the active game module provides.

#### Dual Display: Tier + Rating

Every ranked player sees BOTH:
- **Tier badge:** "Captain II" with icon and color — milestone-driven motivation
- **Rating number:** "1847 ± 45" — transparency, eliminates "why didn't I rank up?" frustration

This follows the industry trend toward transparency: CS2's shift from hidden MMR to visible CS Rating was universally praised, SC2 made MMR visible in 2020 to positive reception, and Dota 2 shows raw MMR at Immortal tier. IC does this from day one — no hidden intermediary layers (unlike LoL's LP system, which creates MMR/LP disconnects that frustrate players).

```rust
/// Tier resolution — lives in ic-ui, reads from game module YAML config.
/// NOT in ic-sim (tiers are display-only, not gameplay).
pub struct RankedTierDisplay {
    pub tier_name: String,         // e.g., "Captain"
    pub division: u8,              // e.g., 2 (for "Captain II")
    pub division_label: String,    // e.g., "II"
    pub icon_path: String,
    pub color: [u8; 3],            // RGB
    pub rating: i64,               // actual rating number (always shown)
    pub deviation: i64,            // uncertainty (shown as ±)
    pub is_elite: bool,            // General/Supreme Commander
    pub leaderboard_position: Option<u32>,  // only for elite tiers
    pub peak_tier: Option<String>, // highest tier this season (e.g., "Colonel I")
}
```

#### Rating Details Panel (Expanded Stats)

The compact display ("Captain II — 1847 ± 45") covers most players' needs. But analytically-minded players — and anyone who watched a "What is Glicko-2?" explainer — want to inspect their full rating parameters. The **Rating Details** panel expands from the Statistics Card's `[Rating Graph →]` link and provides complete transparency into every number the system tracks.

**Panel components:**

1. **Current Rating box:** All three Glicko-2 parameters displayed with plain names. The "Range" line shows the 95% confidence interval ($\mu \pm 2 \times RD$). The "Trend" indicator compares current volatility to the player's 20-match average: ↑ Rising (recent upsets), ── Stable, ↓ Settling (consistent results).

2. **Plain-language explainer:** Collapsible on repeat visits (state stored in `preferences.db`). Uses no jargon — "how certain the system is" instead of "rating deviation." Players who watch Glicko-2 explainer videos will recognize the terms; players who don't will understand the meaning.

3. **Rating history graph:** Client-side chart (Bevy 2D line renderer) from match SCR data. Toggle overlays: confidence band (±2·RD as shaded region around the rating line), per-faction line split, deviation history. Hoverable data points show match details.

4. **Recent matches with rating impact:** Each match shows the rating delta, deviation change, and a bar indicating relative impact magnitude. Explanatory text contextualizes why gains/losses vary — teaching the player how Glicko-2 works through their own data.

5. **Faction breakdown:** Per-faction rating (if faction tracking is enabled, D055 § Faction-Specific Ratings). Shows each faction's independent rating, deviation, match count, and win rate. Random-faction matches contribute to all faction ratings equally.

6. **Rating distribution histogram:** Shows where the player falls in the community's population. The △ marker shows "you are here." Population percentile and count of higher-rated players give concrete context. Data sourced from the community server's leaderboard endpoint (cached locally, refreshed hourly).

7. **CSV export:** Exports full rating history (match date, opponent rating, result, rating change, deviation change, volatility) as a CSV file — consistent with the "player data is a platform" philosophy (D034). Community stat tools, spreadsheet analysts, and researchers can work with the raw data.

**Where this lives in the UI:**

- **In-game path:** Main Menu → Profile → Statistics Card → `[Rating Graph →]` → Rating Details Panel
- **Post-game:** The match result screen includes a compact rating change widget ("1957 → 1971, +14") that links to the full panel
- **Tooltip:** Hovering over anyone's rank badge in lobbies, match results, or friends list shows a compact version (rating ± deviation, tier, percentile)
- **Console command:** `/rating` or `/stats rating` opens the panel. `/rating <player>` shows another player's public rating details.

#### Glicko-2 RTS Adaptations

Standard Glicko-2 was designed for chess: symmetric, no map variance, no faction asymmetry, large populations, frequent play. IC's competitive environment differs on every axis. The `Glicko2Provider` (D041) implements standard Glicko-2 with the following RTS-specific parameter tuning:

**Parameter configuration (YAML-driven, per community server):**

```yaml
# Server-side Glicko-2 configuration
glicko2:
  # Standard Glicko-2 parameters
  default_rating: 1500            # New player starting rating
  default_deviation: 350          # New player RD (high = fast convergence)
  system_constant_tau: 0.5        # Volatility constraint (standard range: 0.3–1.2)

  # IC RTS adaptations
  rd_floor: 45                    # Minimum RD — prevents rating "freezing"
  rd_ceiling: 350                 # Maximum RD (equals placement-level uncertainty)
  inactivity_c: 34.6              # RD growth constant for inactive players
  rating_period_days: 0           # 0 = per-match updates (no batch periods)

  # Match quality weighting
  match_duration_weight:
    min_ticks: 3600               # 2 minutes at 30 tps — below this, reduced weight
    full_weight_ticks: 18000      # 10 minutes — at or above this, full weight
    short_game_factor: 300        # 0-1000 fixed-point weight for games < min_ticks
  
  # Team game handling (2v2, 3v3)
  team_rating_method: "weighted_average"  # or "max_rating", "trueskill"
  team_individual_share: true     # distribute rating change by contribution weight
```

**Adaptation 1 — RD floor (min deviation = 45):**

Standard Glicko-2 allows RD to approach zero for highly active players, making their rating nearly immovable. This is problematic for competitive games where skill fluctuates with meta shifts, patch changes, and life circumstances. An RD floor of 45 ensures that even the most active player's rating responds meaningfully to results.

Why 45: Valve's CS Regional Standings uses RD = 75 for 5v5 team play. In 1v1 RTS, each match provides more information per player (no teammates to attribute results to), so a lower floor is appropriate. At RD = 45, the 95% confidence interval is ±90 rating points — enough precision to distinguish skill while remaining responsive.

The RD floor is enforced after each rating update: `rd = max(rd_floor, computed_rd)`. This is the simplest adaptation and has the largest impact on player experience.

**Adaptation 2 — Per-match rating periods:**

Standard Glicko-2 groups matches into "rating periods" (typically a fixed time window) and updates ratings once per period. This made sense for postal chess where you complete a few games per month. RTS players play 2–5 games per session and want immediate feedback.

IC updates ratings after every individual match — each match is its own rating period with $m = 1$. This is mathematically equivalent to running Glicko-2 Step 1–8 with a single game per period. The deviation update (Step 3) and rating update (Step 7) reflect one result, then the new rating becomes the input for the next match.

This means the post-game screen shows the exact rating change from that match, not a batched update. Players see "+14" or "-18" and understand immediately what happened.

**Adaptation 3 — Information content weighting by match duration:**

A 90-second game where one player disconnects during load provides almost no skill information. A 20-minute game with multiple engagements provides rich skill signal. Standard Glicko-2 treats all results equally.

IC scales the rating impact of each match by an `information_content` factor (already defined in D041's `MatchQuality`). Match duration is one input:

- Games shorter than `min_ticks` (2 minutes): weight = `short_game_factor` (default 0.3×)
- Games between `min_ticks` and `full_weight_ticks` (2–10 minutes): linearly interpolated
- Games at or above `full_weight_ticks` (10+ minutes): full weight (1.0×)

Implementation: the `g(RD)` function in Glicko-2 Step 3 is not modified. Instead, the expected outcome $E$ is scaled by the information content factor before computing the rating update. This preserves the mathematical properties of Glicko-2 while reducing the impact of low-quality matches.

Other `information_content` inputs (from D041): game mode weight (ranked = 1.0, casual = 0.5), player count balance (1v1 = 1.0, 1v2 = 0.3), and opponent rematching penalty (V26: `weight = base × 0.5^(n-1)` for repeated opponents).

**Adaptation 4 — Inactivity RD growth targeting seasonal cadence:**

Standard Glicko-2 increases RD over time when a player is inactive: $RD_{new} = \sqrt{RD^2 + c^2 \cdot t}$ where $c$ is calibrated and $t$ is the number of rating periods elapsed. IC tunes $c$ so that a player who is inactive for one full season (91 days) reaches RD ≈ 250 — high enough that their first few matches back converge quickly, but not reset to placement level (350).

With `c = 34.6` and daily periods: after 91 days, $RD = \sqrt{45^2 + 34.6^2 \times 91} \approx 250$. This means returning players re-stabilize in ~5–10 matches rather than the 25+ that a full reset would require.

**Adaptation 5 — Team game rating distribution:**

Glicko-2 is designed for 1v1. For team games (2v2, 3v3), IC uses a weighted-average team rating for matchmaking quality assessment, then distributes rating changes individually based on the result:

- Team rating for matchmaking: weighted average of member ratings (weights = 1/RD, so more-certain players count more)
- Post-match: each player's rating updates as if they played a 1v1 against the opposing team's weighted average
- Deviation updates independently per player

This is a pragmatic adaptation, not a theoretically optimal one. For communities that want better team rating, D041's `RankingProvider` trait allows substituting TrueSkill (designed specifically for team games) or any custom algorithm.

**What IC does NOT modify:**

- **Glicko-2 Steps 1–8 core algorithm:** The mathematical update procedure is standard. No custom "performance bonus" adjustments for APM, eco score, or unit efficiency. Win/loss/draw is the only result input. This prevents metric-gaming (players optimizing for stats instead of winning) and keeps the system simple and auditable.
- **Volatility calculation:** The iterative Illinois algorithm for computing new σ is unmodified. The `system_constant_tau` parameter controls sensitivity — community servers can tune this, but the formula is standard.
- **Rating scale:** Standard Glicko-2 rating range (~800–2400, centered at 1500). No artificial scaling or normalization.

#### Why Ranks, Not Leagues

IC uses **military ranks** (Cadet → Supreme Commander), not **leagues** (Bronze → Grandmaster). This is a deliberate thematic and structural choice.

**Thematic alignment:** Players command armies. Military rank progression *is* the fantasy — you're not "placed in Gold league," you *earned the rank of Colonel*. The Cold War military theme matches IC's identity (the engine is named "Iron Curtain"). Every rank implies command authority: even Cadet (officer trainee) is on the path to leading troops, not a foot soldier following orders. The hierarchy follows actual military rank order through General — then transcends it: "Supreme Commander" isn't a rank you're promoted to, it's a title you *earn* by being one of the top 200. Real military parallels exist (STAVKA's Supreme Commander-in-Chief, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander), and the name carries instant genre recognition.

**Structural reasons:**

| Dimension                   | Ranks (IC approach)                                     | Leagues (SC2 approach)                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assignment                  | Rating threshold → rank label                           | Placement → league group of ~100 players                             |
| Population requirement      | Works at any scale (50 or 50,000 players)               | Needs thousands to fill meaningful groups                            |
| Progression feel            | Continuous — every match moves you toward the next rank | Grouped — you're placed once per season, then grind within the group |
| Identity language           | "I'm a Colonel" (personal achievement)                  | "I'm in Diamond" (group membership)                                  |
| Demotion                    | Immediate if rating drops below threshold (honest)      | Often delayed or hidden to avoid frustration (dishonest)             |
| Cross-community portability | Rating → rank mapping is deterministic from YAML config | League placement requires server-side group management               |

**The naming decision:** The tier names themselves carry weight. "Cadet" is where everyone starts — you're an officer-in-training, unproven. "Major" means you've earned mid-level command authority. "Supreme Commander" is the pinnacle — a title that evokes both Cold War gravitas (the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Armed Forces was the head of STAVKA) and the RTS genre itself. These names are IC's brand, not generic color bands.

For other game modules, the rank names change to match the theme — Tiberian Dawn might use GDI/Nod military ranks, a fantasy mod might use feudal titles — but the *structure* (rating thresholds → named ranks × divisions) stays the same. The YAML configuration in `ranked-tiers.yaml` makes this trivially customizable.

**Why not both?** SC2's system was technically a hybrid: leagues (groups of players) with tier labels (Bronze, Silver, Gold). IC's approach is simpler: there are no player groups or league divisions. Your rank is a pure function of your rating — deterministic, portable, and verifiable from the YAML config alone. If you know the tier thresholds and your rating, you know your rank. No server-side group assignment needed. This is critical for D052's federated model, where community servers may have different populations but should be able to resolve the same rating to the same rank label.

#### Season Structure

```yaml
# Server configuration (community server operators can customize)
season:
  duration_days: 91              # ~3 months (matching SC2, CS2, AoE4)
  placement_matches: 10          # Required before rank is assigned
  soft_reset:
    # At season start, compress all ratings toward default:
    # new_rating = default + (old_rating - default) * compression_factor
    compression_factor: 700       # 0-1000 fixed-point (0.7 = keep 70% of distance from default)
    default_rating: 1500          # Center point
    reset_deviation: true         # Set deviation to placement level (fast convergence)
    placement_deviation: 350      # High deviation during placement (ratings move fast)
  rewards:
    # Per-tier season-end rewards (cosmetic only — no gameplay advantage)
    enabled: true
    # Specific rewards defined per-season by competitive committee (D037)
  leaderboard:
    min_matches: 5                # Minimum matches to appear on leaderboard
    min_distinct_opponents: 5     # Must have played at least 5 different opponents (V26)
```

**Season lifecycle:**
1. **Season start:** All player ratings compressed toward 1500 (soft reset). Deviation set to placement level (350). Players lose their tier badge until placement completes.
2. **Placement (10 matches):** High deviation means rating moves fast. Uses D041's seeding formula for brand-new players. Returning players converge quickly because their pre-reset rating provides a strong prior. **Hidden matchmaking rating (V30):** during placement, matchmaking searches near the player's pre-reset rating (not the compressed value), preventing cross-skill mismatches in the first few days of each season. Placement also requires **10 distinct opponents** (soft requirement — degrades gracefully to `max(3, available * 0.5)` on small servers) to prevent win-trading (V26).
3. **Active season:** Normal Glicko-2 rating updates. Deviation decreases with more matches (rating stabilizes). Tier badge updates immediately after every match (no delayed batches — avoiding OW2's mistake).
4. **Season end:** Peak tier badge saved to profile (D053). Season statistics archived. Season rewards distributed. Leaderboard frozen for display.
5. **Inter-season:** Short transition period (~1 week) with unranked competitive practice queue.

**Why 3-month seasons:**
- Matches SC2's proven cadence for RTS
- Long enough for ratings to stabilize and leaderboards to mature
- Short enough to prevent stagnation (the C&C Remastered problem)
- Aligns naturally with quarterly balance patches and competitive map pool rotations

#### Faction-Specific Ratings (Optional)

```yaml
# Player opted into faction tracking:
faction_ratings:
  enabled: true                  # Player's choice — optional
  # Separate rating tracked per faction played
  # Matchmaking uses the rating for the selected faction
  # Profile shows all faction ratings
```

Inspired by SC2's per-race MMR. When enabled:
- Each faction (e.g., Allies, Soviets) has a separate `PlayerRating`
- Matchmaking uses the rating for the faction the player queues with
- Profile displays all faction ratings (D053 statistics card)
- If disabled, one unified rating is used regardless of faction choice

**Why optional:** Some players want one rating that represents their overall skill. Others want per-faction tracking because they're "Diamond Allies but Gold Soviets." Making it opt-in respects both preferences without splitting the matchmaking pool (matchmaking always uses the relevant rating — either faction-specific or unified).

#### Matchmaking Queue Design

**Queue modes:**
- **Ranked 1v1:** Primary competitive mode. Map veto from seasonal pool.
- **Ranked Team:** 2v2, 3v3 (match size defined by game module). Separate team rating. Party restrictions: maximum 1 tier difference between party members (anti-boosting, same as LoL's duo restrictions).
- **Unranked Competitive:** Same rules as ranked but no rating impact. For practice, warm-up, or playing with friends across wide skill gaps.

**Map selection (ranked 1v1):**
Both players alternately ban maps from the competitive map pool (curated per-season by competitive committee, D037). The remaining map is played — similar to CS2 Premier's pick/ban system but adapted for 1v1 RTS.

**Map pool curation guidelines:** The competitive committee should evaluate maps for competitive suitability beyond layout and balance. Relevant considerations include:
- **Weather sim effects (D022):** Maps with `sim_effects: true` introduce movement variance from dynamic weather (snow slowing units, ice enabling water crossing, mud bogging vehicles). The committee may include weather-active maps if the weather schedule is deterministic and strategically interesting, or exclude them if the variance is deemed unfair. Tournament organizers can override this via lobby settings.
- **Map symmetry and spawn fairness:** Standard competitive map criteria — positional balance, resource distribution, rush distance equity.
- **Performance impact:** Maps with extreme cell counts, excessive weather particles, or complex terrain should be tested against the 500-unit performance target (10-PERFORMANCE.md) before inclusion.

**Anonymous veto (V27):** During the veto sequence, opponents are shown as "Opponent" — no username, rating, or tier badge. Identity is revealed only after the final map is determined and both players confirm ready. Leaving during the veto sequence counts as a loss (escalating cooldown: 5min → 30min → 2hr). This prevents identity-based queue dodging while preserving strategic map bans.

```
Seasonal pool: 7 maps
Player A bans 1 → 6 remain
Player B bans 1 → 5 remain
Player A bans 1 → 4 remain
Player B bans 1 → 3 remain
Player A bans 1 → 2 remain
Player B bans 1 → 1 remains → this map is played
```

**Small-population matchmaking degradation:**

Critical for RTS communities. The queue must work with 50 players as well as 5,000.

```rust
/// Matchmaking search parameters — widen over time.
/// These are server-configurable defaults.
pub struct MatchmakingConfig {
    /// Initial rating search range (one-sided).
    /// A player at 1500 searches 1500 ± initial_range.
    pub initial_range: i64,           // default: 100

    /// Range widens by this amount every `widen_interval` seconds.
    pub widen_step: i64,              // default: 50

    /// How often (seconds) to widen the search range.
    pub widen_interval_secs: u32,     // default: 30

    /// Maximum search range before matching with anyone available.
    pub max_range: i64,               // default: 500

    /// After this many seconds, match with any available player.
    /// Only activates if ≥3 players are in queue (V31).
    pub desperation_timeout_secs: u32, // default: 300 (5 minutes)

    /// Minimum match quality (fairness score from D041).
    /// Matches below this threshold are not created even at desperation (V30).
    pub min_match_quality: f64,       // default: 0.3
}
```

The UI displays estimated queue time based on current population and the player's rating position. At low population, the UI shows "~2 min (12 players in queue)" transparently rather than hiding the reality.

**New account anti-smurf measures:**
- First 10 ranked matches have high deviation (fast convergence to true skill)
- New accounts with extremely high win rates in placement are fast-tracked to higher ratings (D041 seeding formula)
- Relay server behavioral analysis (Phase 5 anti-cheat) detects mechanical skill inconsistent with account age
- Optional: phone verification for ranked queue access (configurable by community server operator)
- Diminishing `information_content` for repeated pairings: `weight = base * 0.5^(n-1)` where n = recent rematches within 30 days (V26)
- Desperation matches (created after search widening) earn reduced rating change proportional to skill gap (V31)
- Collusion detection: accounts with >50% matches against the same opponent in a 14-day window are flagged for review (V26)

#### Peak Rank Display

Each player's profile (D053) shows:
- **Current rank:** The tier + division where the player stands right now
- **Peak rank (this season):** The highest tier achieved this season — never decreases within a season

This is inspired by Valorant's act rank and Dota 2's medal system. It answers "what's the best I reached?" without the full one-way-medal problem (Dota 2's medals never drop, making them meaningless by season end). IC's approach: current rank is always accurate, but peak rank is preserved as an achievement.

### Community Replaceability

Per D052's federated model, ranked matchmaking is **community-owned:**

| Component                | Official IC default                    | Community can customize?                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Rating algorithm         | Glicko-2 (`Glicko2Provider`)           | Yes — `RankingProvider` trait (D041)      |
| Tier names & icons       | Cold War military (RA module)          | Yes — YAML per game module/mod            |
| Tier thresholds          | Defined in `ranked-tiers.yaml`         | Yes — YAML per game module/community      |
| Number of tiers          | 7 + 2 elite = 9                        | Yes — YAML-configurable                   |
| Season duration          | 91 days                                | Yes — server configuration                |
| Placement match count    | 10                                     | Yes — server configuration                |
| Map pool                 | Curated by competitive committee       | Yes — per-community                       |
| Queue modes              | 1v1, team                              | Yes — game module defines available modes |
| Anti-smurf measures      | Behavioral analysis + fast convergence | Yes — server operator toggles             |
| Balance preset per queue | Classic RA (D019)                      | Yes — community chooses per-queue         |

**What is NOT community-customizable** (hard requirements):
- Match certification must use relay-signed `CertifiedMatchResult` (D007) — no self-reported results
- Rating records must use D052's SCR format — portable credentials require standardized format
- Tier resolution logic is engine-provided — communities customize the YAML data, not the resolution code

### Alternatives Considered

- **Raw rating only, no tiers** (rejected — C&C Remastered showed that numbers alone lack motivational hooks. The research clearly shows that named milestones drive engagement in every successful ranked system)
- **LoL-style LP system with promotion series** (rejected — LP/MMR disconnect is the most complained-about feature in LoL. Promotion series were so unpopular that Riot removed them in 2024. IC should not repeat this error)
- **Dota 2-style one-way medals** (rejected — medals that never decrease within a season become meaningless by season end. A "Divine" player who dropped to "Archon" MMR still shows Divine — misleading, not motivating)
- **OW2-style delayed rank updates** (rejected — rank updating only after 5 wins or 15 losses was universally criticized. Players want immediate feedback after every match)
- **CS2-style per-map ranking** (rejected for launch — fragments an already-small RTS population. Per-map statistics can be tracked without separate per-map ratings. Could be reconsidered if IC's population is large enough)
- **Elo instead of Glicko-2** (rejected as default — Glicko-2 handles uncertainty better, which is critical for players who play infrequently. D041's `RankingProvider` trait allows communities to use Elo if they prefer)
- **10+ named tiers** (rejected — too many tiers for expected RTS population size. Adjacent tiers become meaningless when population is small. 7+2 matches SC2's proven structure)
- **Single global ranking across all community servers** (rejected — violates D052's federated model. Each community owns its rankings. Cross-community credential verification via SCR ensures portability without centralization)
- **Mandatory phone verification for ranked** (rejected as mandatory — makes ranked inaccessible in regions without phone access, on WASM builds, and for privacy-conscious users. Available as opt-in toggle for community operators)
- **Performance-based rating adjustments** (deferred — Valorant uses individual stats to adjust RR gains. For RTS this would be complex: which metrics predict skill beyond win/loss? Economy score, APM, unit efficiency? Risks encouraging stat-chasing over winning. Could be a future `RankingProvider` enhancement if the community wants it)
- **SC2-style leagues with player groups** (rejected — SC2's league system places players into divisions of ~100 who compete against each other within a tier. This requires thousands of concurrent players to fill meaningful groups. IC's expected population — hundreds to low thousands — can't sustain this. Ranks are pure rating thresholds: deterministic, portable across federated communities (D052), and functional with 50 players or 50,000. See § "Why Ranks, Not Leagues" above)
- **Color bands instead of named ranks** (rejected — CS2 Premier uses color bands (Grey → Gold) which are universal but generic. Military rank names are IC's thematic identity: "Colonel" means something in an RTS where you command armies. Color bands could be a community-provided alternative via YAML, but the default should carry the Cold War fantasy)
- **Enlisted ranks as lower tiers** (rejected — having "Private" or "Corporal" as the lowest ranks breaks the RTS fantasy: the player is always commanding armies, not following orders as a foot soldier. All tiers are officer-grade because the player is always in a command role. "Cadet" as the lowest tier signals "unproven officer" rather than "infantry grunt")
- **Naval rank names** (rejected — "Commander" is a naval rank, not army. "Commodore" and "Admiral" belong at sea. IC's default is an army hierarchy: Lieutenant → Captain → Major → Colonel → General. A naval mod could define its own tier names via YAML)
- **Modified Glicko-2 with performance bonuses** (rejected — some systems (Valorant, CS2) adjust rating gains based on individual performance metrics like K/D or round impact. For RTS this creates perverse incentives: optimizing eco score or APM instead of winning. The result (Win/Loss/Draw) is the only input to Glicko-2. Match duration weighting through `information_content` is the extent of non-result adjustment)

#### Ranked Match Lifecycle

D055 defines the rating system and matchmaking queue. The full competitive match lifecycle — ready-check, game pause, surrender, disconnect penalties, spectator delay, and post-game flow — is specified in `03-NETCODE.md` § "Match Lifecycle." This separation is deliberate: the match lifecycle is a network protocol concern that applies to all game modes (with ranked-specific constraints), while D055 is specifically about the rating and tier system.

**Key ranked-specific constraints** (enforced by the relay server based on lobby mode):
- Ready-check accept timeout: 30 seconds. Declining = escalating queue cooldown.
- Pause: 2 per player, 120 seconds max total per player, 30-second grace before opponent can unpause.
- Surrender: Immediate in 1v1 (`/gg` or surrender button). Vote in team games. No surrender before 5 minutes.
- Kick: Kicked player receives full loss + queue cooldown (same as abandon). Team's units redistributed.
- Remake: Voided match, no rating change. Only available in first 5 minutes.
- Draw: Treated as Glicko-2 draw (0.5 result). Both players' deviations decrease.
- Disconnect: Full loss + escalating queue cooldown (5min → 30min → 2hr). Reconnection within 60s = no penalty. Grace period voiding for early abandons (<2 min, <5% game progress).
- Spectator delay: 2 minutes (3,600 ticks). Players cannot disable spectating in ranked (needed for anti-cheat review).
- Post-game: 30-second lobby with stats, rating change display, report button, instant re-queue option.

See `03-NETCODE.md` § "Match Lifecycle" for the full protocol, data structures, rationale, and the In-Match Vote Framework that generalizes surrender/kick/remake/draw into a unified callvote system.

### Integration with Existing Decisions

- **D041 (RankingProvider):** `display_rating()` method implementations use the tier configuration YAML to resolve rating → tier name. The trait's existing interface supports D055 without modification — tier resolution is a display concern in `ic-ui`, not a trait responsibility.
- **D052 (Community Servers):** Each community server's ranking authority stores tier configuration alongside its `RankingProvider` implementation. SCR records store the raw rating; tier resolution is display-side.
- **D053 (Player Profile):** The statistics card (rating ± deviation, peak rating, match count, win rate, streak, faction distribution) now includes tier badge, peak tier this season, and season history. The `[Rating Graph →]` link opens the Rating Details panel — full Glicko-2 parameter visibility, rating history chart, faction breakdown, confidence interval, and population distribution.
- **D037 (Competitive Governance):** The competitive committee curates the seasonal map pool, recommends tier threshold adjustments based on population distribution, and proposes balance preset selections for ranked queues.
- **D019 (Balance Presets):** Ranked queues can be tied to specific balance presets — e.g., "Classic RA" ranked vs. "IC Balance" ranked as separate queues with separate ratings.
- **D036 (Achievements):** Seasonal achievements: "Reach Captain," "Place in top 100," "Win 50 ranked matches this season," etc.
- **D034 (SQLite Storage):** `MatchmakingStorage` trait's existing methods (`update_rating()`, `record_match()`, `get_leaderboard()`) handle all ranked data persistence. Season history added as new tables.
- **03-NETCODE.md (Match Lifecycle):** Ready-check, pause, surrender, disconnect penalties, spectator delay, and post-game flow. D055 sets ranked-specific parameters; the match lifecycle protocol is game-mode-agnostic. The **In-Match Vote Framework** (`03-NETCODE.md` § "In-Match Vote Framework") generalizes the surrender vote into a generic callvote system (surrender, kick, remake, draw, mod-defined) with per-vote-type ranked constraints.
- **05-FORMATS.md (Analysis Event Stream):** `PauseEvent`, `MatchEnded`, and `VoteEvent` analysis events record match lifecycle moments in the replay for tooling without re-simulation.

### Relationship to `research/ranked-matchmaking-analysis.md`

This decision is informed by cross-game analysis of CS2/CSGO, StarCraft 2, League of Legends, Valorant, Dota 2, Overwatch 2, Age of Empires IV, and C&C Remastered Collection's competitive systems. Key takeaways incorporated:

1. **Transparency trend** (§ 4.2): dual display of tier + rating from day one
2. **Tier count sweet spot** (§ 4.3): 7+2 = 9 tiers for RTS population sizes
3. **3-month seasons** (§ 4.4): RTS community standard (SC2), prevents stagnation
4. **Small-population design** (§ 4.5): graceful matchmaking degradation, configurable widening
5. **C&C Remastered lessons** (§ 3.4): community server ownership, named milestones > raw numbers, seasonal structure prevents stagnation
6. **Faction-specific ratings** (§ 2.1): SC2's per-race MMR adapted for IC's faction system

## D056: Foreign Replay Import (OpenRA & Remastered Collection)

**Status:** Settled
**Phase:** Phase 5 (Multiplayer) — decoders in Phase 2 (Simulation) for testing use
**Depends on:** D006 (Pluggable Networking), D011 (Cross-Engine Compatibility), `ra-formats` crate, `ic-protocol` (OrderCodec trait)

### Problem

The C&C community has accumulated thousands of replay files across two active engines:

- **OpenRA** — `.orarep` files (ZIP archives containing order streams + metadata YAML)
- **C&C Remastered Collection** — binary `EventClass` recordings via `Queue_Record()` / `Queue_Playback()` (DoList serialization per frame, with header from `Save_Recording_Values()`)

These replays represent community history, tournament archives, and — critically for IC — a massive corpus of **known-correct gameplay sequences** that can be used as behavioral regression tests. If IC's simulation handles the same orders and produces visually wrong results (units walking through walls, harvesters ignoring ore, Tesla Coils not firing), that's a bug we can catch automatically.

Without foreign replay support, this testing corpus is inaccessible. Additionally, players switching to IC lose access to their replay libraries — a real migration friction point.

### Decision

**Support direct playback of OpenRA and Remastered Collection replay files, AND provide a converter to IC's native `.icrep` format.**

Both paths are supported because they serve different needs:

| Capability                        | Direct Playback                                      | Convert to `.icrep`                           |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Use case**                      | Quick viewing, casual browsing                       | Archival, analysis tooling, regression tests  |
| **Requires original engine sim?** | No — runs through IC's sim                           | No — conversion is a format translation       |
| **Bit-identical to original?**    | No — IC's sim will diverge (D011)                    | N/A — stored as IC orders, replayed by IC sim |
| **Analysis events available?**    | Only if IC re-derives them during playback           | Yes — generated during conversion playback    |
| **Signature chain?**              | Not applicable (foreign replays aren't relay-signed) | Unsigned (provenance metadata preserved)      |
| **Speed**                         | Instant (stream-decode on demand)                    | One-time batch conversion                     |

### Architecture

#### Foreign Replay Decoders (in `ra-formats`)

Foreign replay file parsing belongs in `ra-formats` — it reads C&C-family file formats, which is exactly what this crate exists for. The decoders produce a uniform intermediate representation:

```rust
/// A decoded foreign replay, normalized to a common structure.
/// Lives in `ra-formats`. No dependency on `ic-sim` or `ic-net`.
pub struct ForeignReplay {
    pub source: ReplaySource,
    pub metadata: ForeignReplayMetadata,
    pub initial_state: ForeignInitialState,
    pub frames: Vec<ForeignFrame>,
}

pub enum ReplaySource {
    OpenRA { mod_id: String, mod_version: String },
    Remastered { game: RemasteredGame, version: String },
}

pub enum RemasteredGame { RedAlert, TiberianDawn }

pub struct ForeignReplayMetadata {
    pub players: Vec<ForeignPlayerInfo>,
    pub map_name: String,
    pub map_hash: Option<String>,
    pub duration_frames: u64,
    pub game_speed: Option<String>,
    pub recorded_at: Option<String>,
}

pub struct ForeignInitialState {
    pub random_seed: u32,
    pub scenario: String,
    pub build_level: Option<u32>,
    pub options: HashMap<String, String>,  // game options (shroud, crates, etc.)
}

/// One frame's worth of decoded orders from a foreign replay.
pub struct ForeignFrame {
    pub frame_number: u64,
    pub orders: Vec<ForeignOrder>,
}

/// A single order decoded from a foreign replay format.
/// Preserves the original order type name for diagnostics.
pub enum ForeignOrder {
    Move { player: u8, unit_ids: Vec<u32>, target_x: i32, target_y: i32 },
    Attack { player: u8, unit_ids: Vec<u32>, target_id: u32 },
    Deploy { player: u8, unit_id: u32 },
    Produce { player: u8, building_type: String, unit_type: String },
    Sell { player: u8, building_id: u32 },
    PlaceBuilding { player: u8, building_type: String, x: i32, y: i32 },
    SetRallyPoint { player: u8, building_id: u32, x: i32, y: i32 },
    // ... other order types common to C&C games
    Unknown { player: u8, raw_type: u32, raw_data: Vec<u8> },
}
```

Two decoder implementations:

```rust
/// Decodes OpenRA .orarep files.
/// .orarep = ZIP archive containing:
///   - orders stream (binary, per-tick Order objects)
///   - metadata.yaml (players, map, mod, outcome)
///   - sync.bin (state hashes per tick for desync detection)
pub struct OpenRAReplayDecoder;

impl OpenRAReplayDecoder {
    pub fn decode(reader: impl Read + Seek) -> Result<ForeignReplay> { ... }
}

/// Decodes Remastered Collection replay files.
/// Binary format: Save_Recording_Values() header + per-frame EventClass records.
/// Format documented in research/remastered-collection-netcode-analysis.md § 6.
pub struct RemasteredReplayDecoder;

impl RemasteredReplayDecoder {
    pub fn decode(reader: impl Read) -> Result<ForeignReplay> { ... }
}
```

#### Order Translation (in `ic-protocol`)

`ForeignOrder` → `TimestampedOrder` translation uses the existing `OrderCodec` trait architecture (already defined in `07-CROSS-ENGINE.md`). A `ForeignReplayCodec` maps foreign order types to IC's `PlayerOrder` enum:

```rust
/// Translates ForeignOrder → TimestampedOrder.
/// Lives in ic-protocol alongside OrderCodec.
pub struct ForeignReplayCodec {
    coord_transform: CoordTransform,
    unit_type_map: HashMap<String, UnitTypeId>,   // "1tnk" → IC's UnitTypeId
    building_type_map: HashMap<String, UnitTypeId>,
}

impl ForeignReplayCodec {
    /// Translate a ForeignFrame into IC TickOrders.
    /// Orders that can't be mapped produce warnings, not errors.
    /// Unknown orders are skipped with a diagnostic log entry.
    pub fn translate_frame(
        &self,
        frame: &ForeignFrame,
        tick_rate_ratio: f64,  // e.g., OpenRA 40fps → IC 30tps
    ) -> (TickOrders, Vec<TranslationWarning>) { ... }
}
```

#### Direct Playback (in `ic-net`)

`ForeignReplayPlayback` wraps the decoder output and implements `NetworkModel`, feeding translated orders to the sim tick by tick:

```rust
/// Plays back a foreign replay through IC's simulation.
/// Implements NetworkModel — the sim has no idea the orders came from OpenRA.
pub struct ForeignReplayPlayback {
    frames: Vec<TickOrders>,          // pre-translated
    current_tick: usize,
    source_metadata: ForeignReplayMetadata,
    translation_warnings: Vec<TranslationWarning>,
    divergence_tracker: DivergenceTracker,
}

impl NetworkModel for ForeignReplayPlayback {
    fn poll_tick(&mut self) -> Option<TickOrders> {
        let frame = self.frames.get(self.current_tick)?;
        self.current_tick += 1;
        Some(frame.clone())
    }
}
```

**Divergence tracking:** Since IC's sim is not bit-identical to OpenRA's or the Remastered Collection's (D011), playback WILL diverge. The `DivergenceTracker` monitors for visible signs of divergence (units in invalid positions, negative resources, dead units receiving orders) and surfaces them in the UI:

```rust
pub struct DivergenceTracker {
    pub orders_targeting_dead_units: u64,
    pub orders_targeting_invalid_positions: u64,
    pub first_likely_divergence_tick: Option<u64>,
    pub confidence: DivergenceConfidence,
}

pub enum DivergenceConfidence {
    /// Playback looks plausible — no obvious divergence detected.
    Plausible,
    /// Minor anomalies detected — playback may be slightly off.
    MinorDrift { tick: u64, details: String },
    /// Major divergence — orders no longer make sense for current game state.
    Diverged { tick: u64, details: String },
}
```

The UI shows a subtle indicator: green (plausible) → yellow (minor drift) → red (diverged). Players can keep watching past divergence — they just know the playback is no longer representative of the original game.

#### Conversion to `.icrep` (CLI tool)

The `ic` CLI provides a conversion subcommand:

```
ic replay import game.orarep -o game.icrep
ic replay import recording.bin --format remastered-ra -o game.icrep
ic replay import --batch ./openra-replays/ -o ./converted/
```

Conversion process:
1. Decode foreign replay via `ra-formats` decoder
2. Translate all orders via `ForeignReplayCodec`
3. Run translated orders through IC's sim headlessly (generates analysis events + state hashes)
4. Write `.icrep` with `Minimal` embedding mode + provenance metadata

The converted `.icrep` includes provenance metadata in its JSON metadata block:

```json
{
  "replay_id": "...",
  "converted_from": {
    "source": "openra",
    "original_file": "game-20260115-1530.orarep",
    "original_mod": "ra",
    "original_version": "20231010",
    "conversion_date": "2026-02-15T12:00:00Z",
    "translation_warnings": 3,
    "diverged_at_tick": null
  }
}
```

#### Automated Regression Testing

The most valuable use of foreign replay import is **automated behavioral regression testing**:

```
ic replay test ./test-corpus/openra-replays/ --check visual-sanity
```

This runs each foreign replay headlessly through IC's sim and checks for:
- **Order rejection rate:** What percentage of translated orders does IC's sim reject as invalid? A high rate means IC's order validation (D012) disagrees with OpenRA's — worth investigating.
- **Unit survival anomalies:** If a unit that survived the entire original game dies in tick 50 in IC, the combat/movement system likely has a significant behavioral difference.
- **Economy divergence:** Comparing resource trajectories (if OpenRA replay has sync data) against IC's sim output highlights harvesting/refinery bugs early.
- **Crash-free completion:** The replay completes without panics, even if the game state diverges.

This is NOT about achieving bit-identical results (D011 explicitly rejects that). It's about detecting **gross behavioral bugs** — the kind where a tank drives into the ocean or a building can't be placed on flat ground. The foreign replay corpus acts as a "does this look roughly right?" sanity check.

### Tick Rate Reconciliation

OpenRA runs at a configurable tick rate (default 40 tps for Normal speed). The Remastered Collection's original engine runs at approximately 15 fps for game logic. IC targets 30 tps. Foreign replay playback must reconcile these rates:

- **OpenRA 40 tps → IC 30 tps:** Some foreign ticks have no orders and can be merged. Orders are retimed proportionally: foreign tick 120 at 40 tps = 3.0 seconds → IC tick 90 at 30 tps.
- **Remastered ~15 fps → IC 30 tps:** Each foreign frame maps to ~2 IC ticks. Orders land on the nearest IC tick boundary.

The mapping is approximate — sub-tick timing differences mean some orders arrive 1 tick earlier or later than the original. For direct playback this is acceptable (the game will diverge anyway). For regression tests, the tick mapping is deterministic (always the same IC tick for the same foreign tick).

### What This Is NOT

- **NOT cross-engine multiplayer.** Foreign replays are played back through IC's sim only. No attempt to match the original engine's behavior tick-for-tick.
- **NOT a guarantee of visual fidelity.** The game will look "roughly right" for early ticks, then progressively diverge as simulation differences compound. This is expected and documented (D011).
- **NOT a replacement for IC's native replay system.** Native `.icrep` replays are the primary format. Foreign replay support is a compatibility/migration/testing feature.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Convert-only, no direct playback** (rejected — forces a batch step before viewing; users want to double-click an `.orarep` and watch it immediately)
- **Direct playback only, no conversion** (rejected — analysis tooling and regression tests need `.icrep` format; conversion enables the analysis event stream and signature chain)
- **Embed OpenRA/Remastered sim for accurate playback** (rejected — contradicts D011's "not a port" principle; massive dependency; licensing complexity; architecture violation of sim purity)
- **Support only OpenRA, not Remastered** (rejected — Remastered replays are simpler to decode and the community has archives worth preserving; the DoList format is well-documented in EA's GPL source)

### Integration with Existing Decisions

- **D006 (Pluggable Networking):** `ForeignReplayPlayback` is just another `NetworkModel` implementation — the sim doesn't know the orders came from a foreign replay.
- **D011 (Cross-Engine Compatibility):** Foreign replay playback is "Level 1: Replay Compatibility" from `07-CROSS-ENGINE.md` — now with concrete architecture.
- **D023 (OpenRA Vocabulary Compatibility):** The `ForeignReplayCodec` uses the same OpenRA vocabulary mapping (trait names, order names) that D023 established for YAML rules.
- **D025 (Runtime MiniYAML Loading):** OpenRA `.orarep` metadata is MiniYAML — parsed by the same `ra-formats` infrastructure.
- **D027 (Canonical Enum Compatibility):** Foreign order type names (locomotor types, stance names) use D027's enum mappings.

## D057: LLM Skill Library — Lifelong Learning for AI and Content Generation

**Status:** Settled
**Scope:** `ic-llm`, `ic-ai`, `ic-sim` (read-only via `FogFilteredView`)
**Phase:** Phase 7 (LLM Missions + Ecosystem), with AI skill accumulation feasible as soon as D044 ships
**Depends on:** D016 (LLM-Generated Missions), D034 (SQLite Storage), D041 (AiStrategy), D044 (LLM-Enhanced AI), D030 (Workshop)
**Inspired by:** Voyager (NVIDIA/MineDojo, 2023) — LLM-powered lifelong learning agent for Minecraft with an ever-growing skill library of verified, composable, semantically-indexed executable behaviors

### Problem

IC's LLM features are currently **stateless between sessions**:

- **D044 (`LlmOrchestratorAi`):** Every strategic consultation starts from scratch. The LLM receives game state + `AiEventLog` narrative and produces a `StrategicPlan` with no memory of what strategies worked in previous games. A 100-game-old AI is no smarter than a first-game AI.
- **D016 (mission generation):** Every mission is generated from raw prompts or template-filling. The LLM has no knowledge of which encounter compositions produced missions that players rated highly, completed at target difficulty, or found genuinely fun.
- **D044 (`LlmPlayerAi`):** The experimental full-LLM player repeats the same reasoning mistakes across games because it has no accumulated knowledge of what works in Red Alert.

The scene template library (`04-MODDING.md` § Scene Templates) is a **hand-authored** skill library — pre-built, verified building blocks (ambush, patrol, convoy escort, defend position). But there's no mechanism for the LLM to **discover, verify, and accumulate** its own proven patterns over time.

Voyager (Wang et al., 2023) demonstrated that an LLM agent with a **skill library** — verified executable behaviors indexed by semantic embedding, retrieved by similarity, and composed for new tasks — dramatically outperforms a stateless LLM agent. Voyager obtained 3.3x more unique items and unlocked tech tree milestones 15.3x faster than agents without skill accumulation. The key insight: storing verified skills eliminates catastrophic forgetting and compounds the agent's capabilities over time.

IC already has almost every infrastructure piece needed for this pattern. The missing component is the **verification → storage → retrieval → composition** loop that turns individual LLM outputs into a growing library of proven capabilities.

### Decision

Add a **Skill Library** system to `ic-llm` — a persistent, semantically-indexed store of verified LLM outputs that accumulates knowledge across sessions. The library serves two domains with shared infrastructure:

1. **AI Skills** — strategic patterns verified through gameplay outcomes (D044)
2. **Generation Skills** — mission/encounter patterns verified through player ratings and validation (D016)

Both domains use the same storage format, retrieval mechanism, verification pipeline, and sharing infrastructure. They differ only in what constitutes a "skill" and how verification works.

### Architecture

#### The Skill

A skill is a verified, reusable LLM output with provenance and quality metadata:

```rust
/// A verified, reusable LLM output stored in the skill library.
/// Applicable to both AI strategy skills and content generation skills.
pub struct Skill {
    pub id: SkillId,                        // UUID
    pub domain: SkillDomain,
    pub name: String,                       // human-readable, LLM-generated
    pub description: String,                // semantic description for retrieval
    pub description_embedding: Vec<f32>,    // embedding vector for similarity search

    pub composable_with: Vec<SkillId>,      // skills this has been successfully composed with
    pub created_at: String,                 // ISO 8601
    pub last_used: String,
    pub use_count: u32,
}

pub enum SkillDomain {
    /// Strategic AI patterns (D044) — "how to play"
    AiStrategy,
    /// Mission/encounter generation patterns (D016) — "how to build content"
    ContentGeneration,
}

pub enum SkillBody {
    /// A strategic plan template with parameter bindings.
    /// Used by LlmOrchestratorAi to guide inner AI behavior.
    StrategicPattern {
        /// The situation this pattern addresses (serialized game state features).
        situation: SituationSignature,
        /// The StrategicPlan that worked in this situation.
        plan: StrategicPlan,
        /// Parameter adjustments applied to the inner AI.
        parameter_bindings: Vec<(String, i32)>,
    },
    /// A mission encounter composition — scene templates + parameter values.
    /// Used by D016 mission generation to compose proven building blocks.
    EncounterPattern {
        /// Scene template IDs and their parameter values.
        scene_composition: Vec<SceneInstance>,
        /// Overall mission structure metadata.
        mission_structure: MissionStructureHints,
    },
    /// A raw prompt+response pair that produced a verified good result.
    /// Injected as few-shot examples in future LLM consultations.
    VerifiedExample {
        prompt_context: String,
        response: String,
    },
}

pub struct SkillProvenance {
    pub source: SkillSource,
    pub model_id: Option<String>,           // which LLM model generated it
    pub game_module: String,                // "ra1", "td", etc.
    pub engine_version: String,
}

pub enum SkillSource {
    /// Discovered by the LLM during gameplay or generation, then verified.
    LlmDiscovered,
    /// Hand-authored by a human (e.g., built-in scene templates promoted to skills).
    HandAuthored,
    /// Imported from Workshop.
    Workshop { source_id: String, author: String },
    /// Refined from an LLM-discovered skill by a human editor.
    HumanRefined { original_id: SkillId },
}

pub struct SkillQuality {
    pub verification_count: u32,            // how many times verified
    pub success_rate: f64,                  // wins / uses for AI; completion rate for missions
    pub average_rating: Option<f64>,        // player rating (1-5) for generation skills
    pub confidence: SkillConfidence,
    pub last_verified: String,              // ISO 8601
}

pub enum SkillConfidence {
    /// Passed initial validation but low sample size (< 3 verifications).
    Tentative,
    /// Consistently successful across multiple verifications (3-10).
    Established,
    /// Extensively verified with high success rate (10+).
    Proven,
}
```

#### Storage: SQLite (D034)

Skills are stored in SQLite — same embedded database as all other IC persistent state. No external vector database required.

```sql
CREATE TABLE skills (
    id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    domain          TEXT NOT NULL,       -- 'ai_strategy' | 'content_generation'
    name            TEXT NOT NULL,
    description     TEXT NOT NULL,
    body_json       TEXT NOT NULL,       -- JSON-serialized SkillBody
    tags            TEXT NOT NULL,       -- JSON array of tags
    game_module     TEXT NOT NULL,
    source          TEXT NOT NULL,       -- 'llm_discovered' | 'hand_authored' | 'workshop' | 'human_refined'
    model_id        TEXT,
    verification_count  INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    success_rate    REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    average_rating  REAL,
    confidence      TEXT DEFAULT 'tentative',
    use_count       INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at      TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_used       TEXT,
    last_verified   TEXT
);

-- FTS5 for text-based skill retrieval (fast, no external dependencies)
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE skills_fts USING fts5(
    name, description, tags,
    content=skills, content_rowid=rowid
);

-- Embedding vectors stored as BLOBs for similarity search
CREATE TABLE skill_embeddings (
    skill_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES skills(id),
    embedding       BLOB NOT NULL,       -- f32 array, serialized
    model_id        TEXT NOT NULL         -- which embedding model produced this
);

-- Composition history: which skills have been successfully used together
CREATE TABLE skill_compositions (
    skill_a         TEXT REFERENCES skills(id),
    skill_b         TEXT REFERENCES skills(id),
    success_count   INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (skill_a, skill_b)
);
```

**Retrieval strategy (two-tier):**

1. **FTS5 keyword search** — fast, zero-dependency, works offline. Query: `"anti-air defense early-game"` matches skills with those terms in name/description/tags. This is the primary retrieval path and works without an embedding model.
2. **Embedding similarity** — optional, higher quality. If the user's `LlmProvider` (D016) supports embeddings (most do), skill descriptions are embedded at storage time. Retrieval computes cosine similarity between the query embedding and stored embeddings. This is a SQLite scan with in-process vector math — no external vector database.

FTS5 is always available. Embedding similarity is used when an embedding model is configured and falls back to FTS5 otherwise. Both paths return ranked results; the top-K skills are injected into the LLM prompt as few-shot context.

#### Verification Pipeline

The critical difference between a skill library and a prompt cache: **skills are verified**. An unverified LLM output is a candidate; a verified output is a skill.

**AI Strategy verification (D044):**

```
LlmOrchestratorAi generates StrategicPlan
  → Inner AI executes the plan over the next consultation interval
  → Match outcome observed (win/loss, resource delta, army value delta, territory change)
  → If favorable outcome: candidate skill created
  → Candidate includes: SituationSignature (game state features at plan time)
                        + StrategicPlan + parameter bindings + outcome metrics
  → Same pattern used in 3+ games with >60% success → promoted to Established skill
  → 10+ uses with >70% success → promoted to Proven skill
```

`SituationSignature` captures the game state features that made this plan applicable — not the entire state, but the strategically relevant dimensions:

```rust
/// A compressed representation of the game situation when a skill was applied.
/// Used to match current situations against stored skills.
pub struct SituationSignature {
    pub game_phase: GamePhase,              // early / mid / late (derived from tick + tech level)
    pub economy_state: EconomyState,        // ahead / even / behind (relative resource flow)
    pub army_composition: Vec<(String, u8)>, // top unit types by proportion
    pub enemy_composition_estimate: Vec<(String, u8)>,
    pub map_control: f32,                   // 0.0-1.0 estimated map control
    pub threat_level: ThreatLevel,          // none / low / medium / high / critical
    pub active_tech: Vec<String>,           // available tech tiers
}
```

**Content Generation verification (D016):**

```
LLM generates mission (from template or raw)
  → Schema validation passes (valid unit types, reachable objectives, balanced resources)
  → Player plays the mission
  → Outcome observed: completion (yes/no), time-to-complete, player rating (if provided)
  → If completed + rated ≥ 3 stars: candidate encounter skill created
  → Candidate includes: scene composition + parameter values + mission structure + rating
  → Aggregated across 3+ players/plays with avg rating ≥ 3.5 → Established
  → Workshop rating data (if published) feeds back into quality scores
```

**Automated pre-verification (no player required):**

For AI skills, headless simulation provides automated verification:

```
ic skill verify --domain ai --games 20 --opponent "IC Default Hard"
```

This runs the AI with each candidate skill against a reference opponent headlessly, measuring win rate. Skills that pass automated verification at a lower threshold (>40% win rate against Hard AI) are promoted to `Tentative`. Human play promotes them further.

#### Prompt Augmentation — How Skills Reach the LLM

When the `LlmOrchestratorAi` or mission generator prepares a prompt, the skill library injects relevant context:

```rust
/// Retrieves relevant skills and augments the LLM prompt.
pub struct SkillRetriever {
    db: SqliteConnection,
    embedding_provider: Option<Box<dyn EmbeddingProvider>>,
}

impl SkillRetriever {
    /// Find skills relevant to the current context.
    /// Returns top-K skills ranked by relevance, filtered by domain and game module.
    pub fn retrieve(
        &self,
        query: &str,
        domain: SkillDomain,
        game_module: &str,
        max_results: usize,
    ) -> Vec<Skill> {
        // 1. Try embedding similarity if available
        // 2. Fall back to FTS5 keyword search
        // 3. Filter by confidence >= Tentative
        // 4. Rank by (relevance_score * quality.success_rate)
        // 5. Return top-K
        ...
    }

    /// Format retrieved skills as few-shot context for the LLM prompt.
    pub fn format_as_context(&self, skills: &[Skill]) -> String {
        // Each skill becomes a "Previously successful approach:" block
        // in the prompt, with situation → plan → outcome
        ...
    }
}
```

**In the orchestrator prompt flow (D044):**

```
System prompt (from llm/prompts/orchestrator.yaml)
  + "Previously successful strategies in similar situations:"
  + [top 3-5 retrieved AI skills, formatted as situation/plan/outcome examples]
  + "Current game state:"
  + [serialized FogFilteredView]
  + "Recent events:"
  + [event_log.to_narrative(since_tick)]
  → LLM produces StrategicPlan
    (informed by proven patterns, but free to adapt or deviate)
```

**In the mission generation prompt flow (D016):**

```
System prompt (from llm/prompts/mission_generator.yaml)
  + "Encounter patterns that players enjoyed:"
  + [top 3-5 retrieved generation skills, formatted as composition/rating examples]
  + Campaign context (skeleton, current act, character states)
  + Player preferences
  → LLM produces mission YAML
    (informed by proven encounter patterns, but free to create new ones)
```

The LLM is never forced to use retrieved skills — they're few-shot examples that bias toward proven patterns while preserving creative freedom. If the current situation is genuinely novel (no similar skills found), the retrieval returns nothing and the LLM operates as it does today — statelessly.

#### Skill Composition

Complex gameplay requires combining multiple skills. Voyager's key insight: skills compose — "mine iron" + "craft furnace" + "smelt iron ore" compose into "make iron ingots." IC skills compose similarly:

**AI skill composition:**
- "Rush with light vehicles at 5:00" + "transition to heavy armor at 12:00" = an early-aggression-into-late-game strategic arc
- The `composable_with` field and `skill_compositions` table track which skills have been successfully used in sequence
- The orchestrator can retrieve a *sequence* of skills for different game phases, not just a single skill for the current moment

**Generation skill composition:**
- "bridge_ambush" + "timed_extraction" + "weather_escalation" = a specific mission pattern
- This is exactly the existing scene template hierarchy (`04-MODDING.md` § Template Hierarchy), but with LLM-discovered compositions alongside hand-authored ones
- The `EncounterPattern` skill body stores the full composition — which scene templates, in what order, with what parameter values

#### Workshop Distribution (D030)

Skill libraries are Workshop-shareable resources:

```yaml
# workshop/my-ai-skill-library/resource.yaml
type: skill_library
display_name: "Competitive RA1 AI Strategies"
description: "150 verified strategic patterns learned over 500 games against Hard AI"
game_module: ra1
domain: ai_strategy
skill_count: 150
average_confidence: proven
license: CC-BY-SA-4.0
ai_usage: Allow
```

**Sharing model:**
- Players export their skill library (or a curated subset) as a Workshop package
- Other players subscribe and merge into their local library
- Skill provenance tracks origin — `Workshop { source_id, author }`
- Community curation: Workshop ratings on skill libraries indicate quality
- AI tournament leaderboards (D043) can require contestants to publish their skill libraries, creating a knowledge commons

**Privacy:**
- Skill libraries contain **no player data** — only LLM outputs, game state features, and outcome metrics
- No replays, no player names, no match IDs in the exported skill data
- A skill that says "rush at 5:00 with 3 light tanks against enemy who expanded early" reveals a strategy, not a person

#### Skill Lifecycle

```
1. DISCOVERY      LLM generates an output (StrategicPlan or mission content)
        ↓
2. EXECUTION      Output is used in gameplay or mission play
        ↓
3. EVALUATION     Outcome measured (win/loss, rating, completion)
        ↓
4. CANDIDACY      If outcome meets threshold → candidate skill created
        ↓
5. VERIFICATION   Same pattern reused 3+ times with consistent success → Established
        ↓
6. PROMOTION      10+ verifications with high success → Proven
        ↓
7. RETRIEVAL      Proven skills injected as few-shot context in future LLM consultations
        ↓
8. COMPOSITION    Skills used together successfully → composition recorded
        ↓
9. SHARING        Player exports library to Workshop; community benefits
```

**Skill decay:** Skills verified against older engine versions may become less relevant as game balance changes. Skills include `engine_version` in provenance. A periodic maintenance pass (triggered by engine update) re-validates `Proven` skills by running them through headless simulation. Skills that fall below threshold are downgraded to `Tentative` rather than deleted — balance might revert, or the pattern might work in a different context.

**Skill pruning:** Libraries grow unboundedly without curation. Automatic pruning removes skills that are: (a) `Tentative` for >30 days with no additional verifications, (b) `use_count == 0` for >90 days, or (c) superseded by a strictly-better skill (same situation, higher success rate). Manual pruning via `ic skill prune` CLI. Users set a max library size; pruning prioritizes keeping `Proven` skills and removing `Tentative` duplicates.

### Embedding Provider

Embeddings require a model. IC does not ship one — same BYOLLM principle as D016:

```rust
/// Produces embedding vectors from text descriptions.
/// Optional — FTS5 provides retrieval without embeddings.
pub trait EmbeddingProvider: Send + Sync {
    fn embed(&self, text: &str) -> Result<Vec<f32>>;
    fn embedding_dimensions(&self) -> usize;
    fn model_id(&self) -> &str;
}
```

Built-in implementations:
- `OpenAIEmbeddings` — uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` (or compatible API)
- `OllamaEmbeddings` — uses any Ollama model with embedding support (local, free)
- `NoEmbeddings` — disables embedding similarity; FTS5 keyword search only

The embedding model is configured alongside the `LlmProvider` in D047's task routing table. If no embedding provider is configured, the skill library works with FTS5 only — slightly lower retrieval quality, but fully functional offline with zero external dependencies.

### CLI

```
ic skill list [--domain ai|content] [--confidence proven|established|tentative] [--game-module ra1]
ic skill show <skill-id>
ic skill verify --domain ai --games 20 --opponent "IC Default Hard"
ic skill export [--domain ai] [--confidence established+] -o skills.icpkg
ic skill import skills.icpkg [--merge|--replace]
ic skill prune [--max-size 500] [--dry-run]
ic skill stats     # library overview: counts by domain/confidence/game module
```

### What This Is NOT

- **NOT fine-tuning.** The LLM model parameters are never modified. Skills are retrieved context (few-shot examples), not gradient updates. Users never need GPU training infrastructure.
- **NOT a replay database.** Skills store compressed patterns (situation signature + plan + outcome), not full game replays. A skill is ~1-5 KB; a replay is ~2-5 MB.
- **NOT required for any LLM feature to work.** All LLM features (D016, D044) work without a skill library — they just don't improve over time. The library is an additive enhancement, not a prerequisite.
- **NOT a replacement for hand-authored content.** The built-in scene templates, AI behavior presets (D043), and campaign content (D021) are hand-crafted and don't depend on the skill library. The library augments LLM capabilities; it doesn't replace authored content.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Full model fine-tuning per user** (rejected — requires GPU infrastructure, violates BYOLLM portability, incompatible with API-based providers, and risks catastrophic forgetting of general capabilities)
- **Replay-as-skill (store full replays as skills)** (rejected — replays are too large and unstructured for retrieval; skills must be compressed to situation+plan patterns that fit in a prompt context window)
- **External vector database (Pinecone, Qdrant, Chroma)** (rejected — violates D034's "no external DB" principle; SQLite + FTS5 + in-process vector math is sufficient for a skill library measured in hundreds-to-thousands of entries, not millions)
- **Skills stored in the LLM's context window only (no persistence)** (rejected — context windows are bounded and ephemeral; the whole point is cross-session accumulation)
- **Shared global skill library** (rejected — violates local-first privacy principle; players opt in to sharing via Workshop, never forced; global aggregation risks homogenizing strategies)
- **AI training via reinforcement learning instead of skill accumulation** (rejected — RL requires model parameter access, massive compute, and is incompatible with BYOLLM API models; skill retrieval works with any LLM including cloud APIs)

### Integration with Existing Decisions

- **D016 (LLM Missions):** Generation skills are accumulated from D016's mission generation pipeline. The template-first approach (`04-MODDING.md` § LLM + Templates) benefits most — proven template parameter combinations become generation skills, dramatically improving template-filling reliability.
- **D034 (SQLite):** Skill storage uses the same embedded SQLite database as replay catalogs, match history, and gameplay events. New tables, same infrastructure. FTS5 is already available for search.
- **D041 (AiStrategy):** The `AiEventLog`, `FogFilteredView`, and `set_parameter()` infrastructure provide the verification feedback loop. Skill outcomes are measured through the same event pipeline that informs the orchestrator.
- **D043 (AI Presets):** Built-in AI behavior presets can be promoted to hand-authored skills in the library, giving the retrieval system access to the same proven patterns that the preset system encodes — but indexed for semantic search rather than manual selection.
- **D044 (LLM AI):** AI strategy skills directly augment the orchestrator's consultation prompts. The `LlmOrchestratorAi` becomes the primary skill producer and consumer. The `LlmPlayerAi` also benefits — its reasoning improves with proven examples in context.
- **D047 (LLM Configuration Manager):** The embedding provider is configured alongside other LLM providers in D047's task routing table. Task: `embedding` → Provider: Ollama/OpenAI.
- **D030 (Workshop):** Skill libraries are Workshop resources — shareable, versionable, ratable. AI tournament communities can maintain curated skill libraries.
- **D031 (Observability):** Skill retrieval, verification, and promotion events are logged as telemetry events — observable in Grafana dashboards for debugging skill library behavior.

### Relationship to Voyager

IC's skill library adapts Voyager's three core insights to the RTS domain:

| Voyager Concept                                 | IC Adaptation                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Skill = executable JavaScript function**      | Skill = `StrategicPlan` (AI) or `EncounterPattern` (generation) — domain-specific executable content                                                                     |
| **Skill verification via environment feedback** | Verification via match outcome (AI) or player rating + schema validation (generation)                                                                                    |
| **Embedding-indexed retrieval**                 | Two-tier: FTS5 keyword (always available) + optional embedding similarity                                                                                                |
| **Compositional skills**                        | `composable_with` + `skill_compositions` table; scene template hierarchy for generation                                                                                  |
| **Automatic curriculum**                        | Not directly adopted — IC's curriculum is human-driven (player picks missions, matchmaking picks opponents). The skill library accumulates passively during normal play. |
| **Iterative prompting with self-verification**  | Schema validation + headless sim verification (`ic skill verify`) replaces Voyager's in-environment code testing                                                         |

The key architectural difference: Voyager's agent runs in a single-player sandbox with fast iteration loops (try code → observe → refine → store). IC's skills accumulate more slowly — each verification requires a full game or mission play. This means IC's library grows over days/weeks rather than hours, but the skills are verified against real gameplay rather than sandbox experiments, producing higher-quality patterns.

## D058: In-Game Command Console — Unified Chat and Command System

**Status:** Settled
**Scope:** `ic-ui` (chat input, dev console UI), `ic-game` (CommandDispatcher, wiring), `ic-sim` (order pipeline), `ic-script` (Lua execution)
**Phase:** Phase 3 (Game Chrome — chat + basic commands), Phase 4 (Lua console), Phase 6a (mod-registered commands)
**Depends on:** D004 (Lua Scripting), D006 (Pluggable Networking — commands produce PlayerOrders that flow through NetworkModel), D007 (Relay Server — server-enforced rate limits), D012 (Order Validation), D033 (QoL Toggles), D036 (Achievements), D055 (Ranked Matchmaking — competitive integrity)

**Crate ownership:** The `CommandDispatcher` lives in `ic-game` — it cannot live in `ic-sim` (would violate Invariant #1: no I/O in the simulation) and is too cross-cutting for `ic-ui` (CLI and scripts also use it). `ic-game` is the wiring crate that depends on all library crates, making it the natural home for the dispatcher.
**Inspired by:** Mojang's Brigadier (command tree architecture), Factorio (unified chat+command UX), Source Engine (developer console + cvars)

### Problem

IC needs two text-input capabilities during gameplay:

1. **Player chat** — team messages, all-chat, whispers in multiplayer
2. **Commands** — developer cheats, server administration, configuration tweaks, Lua scripting, mod-injected commands

These could be separate systems (Source Engine's tilde console vs. in-game chat) or unified (Factorio's `/` prefix in chat, Minecraft's Brigadier-powered `/` system). The choice affects UX, security, trolling surface, modding ergonomics, and platform portability.

### How Other Games Handle This

| Game/Engine                  | Architecture                                | Console Type                                    | Cheat Consequence                                   | Mod Commands                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Factorio**                 | Unified: chat + `/command` + `/c lua`       | Same input field, `/` prefix routes to commands | `/c` permanently disables achievements for the save | Mods register Lua commands via `commands.add_command()` |
| **Minecraft**                | Unified: chat + Brigadier `/command`        | Same input field, Brigadier tree parser         | Commands in survival may disable advancements       | Mods inject nodes into the Brigadier command tree       |
| **Source Engine (CS2, HL2)** | Separate: `~` developer console + team chat | Dedicated half-screen overlay (tilde key)       | `sv_cheats 1` flags match                           | Server plugins register ConCommands                     |
| **StarCraft 2**              | No text console; debug tools = GUI          | Chat only; no command input                     | N/A (no player-accessible console)                  | Limited custom UI via Galaxy editor                     |
| **OpenRA**                   | GUI-only: DevMode checkbox menu             | No text console; toggle flags in GUI panel      | Flags replay as cheated                             | No mod-injected commands                                |
| **Age of Empires 2/4**       | Chat-embedded: type codes in chat box       | Same input field, magic strings                 | Flags game; disables achievements                   | No mod commands                                         |
| **Arma 3 / OFP**             | Separate: debug console (editor) + chat     | Dedicated windowed Lua/SQF console              | Editor-only; not in normal gameplay                 | Full SQF/Lua API access                                 |

**Key patterns observed:**

1. **Unified wins for UX.** Factorio and Minecraft prove that a single input field with prefix routing (`/` = command, no prefix = chat) is more discoverable and less jarring than a separate overlay. Players don't need to remember two different keybindings. Tab completion works everywhere.

2. **Separate console wins for power users.** Source Engine's tilde console supports multi-line input, scrollback history, cvar browsing, and autocomplete — features that are awkward in a single-line chat field. Power users (modders, server admins, developers) need this.

3. **Achievement/ranking consequences are universal.** Every game that supports both commands and competitive play permanently marks saves/matches when cheats are used. No exceptions.

4. **Trolling via chat is a solved problem.** Muting, ignoring, rate limiting, and admin tools handle chat abuse. The command system introduces a new trolling surface only if commands can affect other players — which is controlled by permissions, not by hiding the console.

5. **Platform portability matters.** A tilde console assumes a physical keyboard. Mobile and console platforms need command access through a GUI or touch-friendly interface.

### Decision

IC uses a **unified chat/command system** with a **Brigadier-style command tree**, plus an optional **developer console overlay** for power users. The two interfaces share the same command dispatcher — they differ only in presentation.

#### The Unified Input (Primary)

A single text input field, opened by pressing Enter (configurable). Prefix routing:

| Input                      | Behavior                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `hello team`               | Team chat message (default)     |
| `/help`                    | Execute command                 |
| `/give 5000`               | Execute command with arguments  |
| `/s hello everyone`        | Shout to all players (all-chat) |
| `/w PlayerName msg`        | Whisper to specific player      |
| `/c game.player.print(42)` | Execute Lua (if permitted)      |

**`/s` vs `/all` distinction:** `/s <message>` is a **one-shot** all-chat message — it sends the rest of the line to all players without changing your active channel. `/all` (D059 § Channel Switching) is a **sticky** channel switch — it changes your default channel to All so subsequent messages go to all-chat until you switch back. Same distinction as IRC's `/say` vs `/join`.

This matches Factorio's model exactly — proven UX with millions of users. The `/` prefix is universal (Minecraft, Factorio, Discord, IRC, MMOs). No learning curve.

**Tab completion** powered by the command tree. Typing `/he` and pressing Tab suggests `/help`. Typing `/give ` suggests valid argument types. The Brigadier-style tree generates completions automatically — mods that register commands get tab completion for free.

**Command visibility.** Following Factorio's principle: by default, all commands executed by any player are visible to all players in the chat log. This prevents covert cheating in multiplayer. Players see `[Admin] /give 5000` or `[Player] /reveal_map`. Lua commands (`/c`) can optionally use `/sc` (silent command) — but only for the host/admin, and the fact that a silent command was executed is still logged (the output is hidden, not the execution).

#### The Developer Console (Secondary, Power Users)

Toggled by `~` (tilde/grave, configurable). A half-screen overlay rendered via `bevy_egui`, inspired by Source Engine:

- **Multi-line input** with syntax highlighting for Lua
- **Scrollable output history** with filtering (errors, warnings, info, chat)
- **Cvar browser** — searchable list of all configuration variables with current values, types, and descriptions
- **Autocomplete** — same Brigadier tree, but with richer display (argument types, descriptions, permission requirements)
- **Command history** — up/down arrow scrolls through previous commands, persisted across sessions in SQLite (D034)

The developer console dispatches commands through the **same `CommandDispatcher`** as the chat input. It provides a better interface for the same underlying system — not a separate system with different commands.

**Compile-gated sections:** The Lua console (`/c`, `/sc`, `/mc`) and debug commands are behind `#[cfg(feature = "dev-tools")]` in release builds. Regular players see only the chat/command interface. The tilde console is always available but shows only non-dev commands unless dev-tools is enabled.

#### Command Tree Architecture (Brigadier-Style)

Already identified in `04-MODDING.md` as the design target. Formalized here:

```rust
/// The source of a command — who is executing it and in what context.
pub struct CommandSource {
    pub origin: CommandOrigin,
    pub permissions: PermissionLevel,
    pub player_id: Option<PlayerId>,
}

pub enum CommandOrigin {
    /// Typed in the in-game chat/command input
    ChatInput,
    /// Typed in the developer console overlay
    DevConsole,
    /// Executed from the CLI tool (`ic` binary)
    Cli,
    /// Executed from a Lua script (mission/mod)
    LuaScript { script_id: String },
    /// Executed from a WASM module
    WasmModule { module_id: String },
    /// Executed from a configuration file
    ConfigFile { path: String },
}

/// How the player physically invoked the action — the hardware/UI input method.
/// Attached to PlayerOrder (not CommandSource) for replay analysis and APM tracking.
/// This is a SEPARATE concept from CommandOrigin: CommandOrigin tracks WHERE the
/// command was dispatched (chat input, dev console, Lua script); InputSource tracks
/// HOW the player physically triggered it (keyboard shortcut, mouse click, etc.).
///
/// NOTE: InputSource is client-reported and advisory only. A modified open-source
/// client can fake any InputSource value. Replay analysis tools should treat it as
/// a hint, not proof. The relay server can verify ORDER VOLUME (spoofing-proof)
/// but not input source (client-reported). See "Competitive Integrity Principles"
/// § CI-3 below.
pub enum InputSource {
    /// Triggered via a keyboard shortcut / hotkey
    Keybinding,
    /// Triggered via mouse click on the game world or GUI button
    MouseClick,
    /// Typed as a chat/console command (e.g., `/move 120,80`)
    ChatCommand,
    /// Loaded from a config file or .iccmd script on startup
    ConfigFile,
    /// Issued by a Lua or WASM script (mission/mod automation)
    Script,
    /// Touchscreen input (mobile/tablet)
    Touch,
    /// Controller input (Steam Deck, console)
    Controller,
}

pub enum PermissionLevel {
    /// Regular player — chat, help, basic status commands
    Player,
    /// Game host — server config, kick/ban, dev mode toggle
    Host,
    /// Server administrator — full server management
    Admin,
    /// Developer — debug commands, Lua console, fault injection
    Developer,
}

/// A typed argument parser — Brigadier's `ArgumentType<T>` in Rust.
pub trait ArgumentType: Send + Sync {
    type Output;
    fn parse(&self, reader: &mut StringReader) -> Result<Self::Output, CommandError>;
    fn suggest(&self, context: &CommandContext, builder: &mut SuggestionBuilder);
    fn examples(&self) -> &[&str];
}

/// Built-in argument types.
pub struct IntegerArg { pub min: Option<i64>, pub max: Option<i64> }
pub struct FloatArg { pub min: Option<f64>, pub max: Option<f64> }
pub struct StringArg { pub kind: StringKind }  // Word, Quoted, Greedy
pub struct BoolArg;
pub struct PlayerArg;           // autocompletes to connected player names
pub struct UnitTypeArg;         // autocompletes to valid unit type names from YAML rules
pub struct PositionArg;         // parses "x,y" or "x,y,z" coordinates
pub struct ColorArg;            // named color or R,G,B

/// The command dispatcher — shared by chat input, dev console, CLI, and scripts.
pub struct CommandDispatcher {
    root: CommandNode,
}

impl CommandDispatcher {
    /// Register a command. Mods call this via Lua/WASM API.
    pub fn register(&mut self, node: CommandNode);

    /// Parse input into a command + arguments. Does NOT execute.
    pub fn parse(&self, input: &str, source: &CommandSource) -> ParseResult;

    /// Execute a previously parsed command.
    pub fn execute(&self, parsed: &ParseResult) -> CommandResult;

    /// Generate tab-completion suggestions at cursor position.
    pub fn suggest(&self, input: &str, cursor: usize, source: &CommandSource) -> Vec<Suggestion>;

    /// Generate human-readable usage string for a command.
    pub fn usage(&self, command: &str, source: &CommandSource) -> String;
}
```

**Permission filtering:** Commands whose root node's permission requirement exceeds the source's level are invisible — not shown in `/help`, not tab-completed, not executable. A regular player never sees `/kick` or `/c`. This is Brigadier's `requirement` predicate.

**Append-only registration:** Mods register commands by adding children to the root node. A mod can also extend existing commands by adding new sub-nodes. Two mods adding `/spawn` would conflict — the second registration merges into the first's node, following Brigadier's merge semantics.

#### Configuration Variables (Cvars)

Runtime-configurable values, inspired by Source Engine's ConVar system but adapted for IC's YAML-first philosophy:

```rust
/// A runtime-configurable variable with type, default, bounds, and metadata.
pub struct Cvar {
    pub name: String,                    // dot-separated: "render.shadows", "sim.fog_enabled"
    pub description: String,
    pub value: CvarValue,
    pub default: CvarValue,
    pub flags: CvarFlags,
    pub category: String,                // for grouping in the cvar browser
}

pub enum CvarValue {
    Bool(bool),
    Int(i64),
    Float(f64),
    String(String),
}

bitflags! {
    pub struct CvarFlags: u32 {
        /// Persisted to config file on change
        const PERSISTENT = 0b0001;
        /// Requires dev mode to modify (gameplay-affecting)
        const DEV_ONLY   = 0b0010;
        /// Server-authoritative in multiplayer (clients can't override)
        const SERVER     = 0b0100;
        /// Read-only — informational, cannot be set by commands
        const READ_ONLY  = 0b1000;
    }
}
```

**Loading from config file:**

```yaml
# config.yaml (user configuration — loaded at startup, saved on change)
render:
  shadows: true
  shadow_quality: 2         # 0=off, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high
  vsync: true
  max_fps: 144

audio:
  master_volume: 80
  music_volume: 60
  eva_volume: 100

gameplay:
  scroll_speed: 5
  control_group_steal: false
  auto_rally_harvesters: true

net:
  show_diagnostics: false       # toggle network overlay (latency, jitter, tick timing)
  sync_frequency: 120           # ticks between full state hash checks (SERVER)
  # DEV_ONLY parameters — debug builds only:
  # desync_debug_level: 0       # 0-3, see 03-NETCODE.md § Debug Levels
  # visual_prediction: true      # cosmetic prediction; disable for latency testing
  # simulate_latency: 0          # artificial one-way latency (ms)
  # simulate_loss: 0.0           # artificial packet loss (%)
  # simulate_jitter: 0           # artificial jitter (ms)

debug:
  show_fps: true
  show_network_stats: false
```

Cvars are the runtime mirror of `config.yaml`. Changing a cvar with `PERSISTENT` flag writes back to `config.yaml`. Cvars map to the same keys as the YAML config — `render.shadows` in the cvar system corresponds to `render.shadows` in the file. This means `config.yaml` is both the startup configuration file and the serialized cvar state.

**Cvar commands:**

| Command               | Description                          | Example                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `/set <cvar> <value>` | Set a cvar                           | `/set render.shadows false` |
| `/get <cvar>`         | Display current value                | `/get render.max_fps`       |
| `/reset <cvar>`       | Reset to default                     | `/reset render.shadows`     |
| `/find <pattern>`     | Search cvars by name/description     | `/find shadow`              |
| `/cvars [category]`   | List all cvars (optionally filtered) | `/cvars audio`              |
| `/toggle <cvar>`      | Toggle boolean cvar                  | `/toggle render.vsync`      |

**Sim-affecting cvars** (like fog of war, game speed) use the `DEV_ONLY` flag and flow through the order pipeline as `PlayerOrder::SetCvar(name, value)` — deterministic, validated, visible to all clients. Client-only cvars (render settings, audio) take effect immediately without going through the sim.

**Note on DeveloperMode interaction:** Dev commands check `DeveloperMode` sim state (V44). In multiplayer, dev mode must be unanimously enabled in the lobby before game start. Dev commands issued without active dev mode are rejected by the sim with an error message. This is enforced at the order validation layer (D012), not the UI layer.

#### Comprehensive Command Catalog

The design principle: **anything the GUI can do, the console can do.** Every button, menu, slider, and toggle in the game UI has a console command equivalent. This enables scripting via `autoexec.cfg`, accessibility for players who prefer keyboard-driven interfaces, and full remote control for tournament administration. Commands are organized by functional domain — matching the system categories in `02-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Engine-core vs. game-module commands:** Per Invariant #9, the engine core is game-agnostic. Commands are split into two registration layers:

- **Engine commands** (registered by the engine, available to all game modules): `/help`, `/set`, `/get`, `/version`, `/fps`, `/volume`, `/screenshot`, `/camera`, `/zoom`, `/ui_scale`, `/ui_theme`, `/locale`, `/save_game`, `/load_game`, `/clear`, `/players`, etc. These operate on engine-level concepts (rendering, audio, camera, files, cvars) and exist regardless of game module.
- **Game-module commands** (registered by the RA1 module via `GameModule::register_commands()`): `/build`, `/sell`, `/deploy`, `/rally`, `/stance`, `/guard`, `/patrol`, `/power`, `/credits`, `/surrender`, `/power_activate`, etc. These operate on RA1-specific gameplay systems — a Dune II module or tower defense total conversion would register different commands. The tables below include both layers; game-module commands are marked with **(RA1)** where the command is game-module-specific rather than engine-generic.

**Implementation phasing:** This catalog is a **reference target**, not a Phase 3 deliverable. Commands are added incrementally as the systems they control are built — unit commands arrive with Phase 2 (simulation), production/building UI commands with Phase 3 (game chrome), observer commands with Phase 5 (multiplayer), etc. The Brigadier `CommandDispatcher` and cvar system are Phase 3; the full catalog grows across Phases 3–6.

**Unit commands (require selection unless noted) (RA1):**

| Command                                                     | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `/locale <code>` | Switch language (e.g., `en`, `de`, `zh-CN`) |
| `/locale_list`   | List available locales                      |

**Note:** Commands that affect simulation state (`/move`, `/attack`, `/build`, `/sell`, `/deploy`, `/stance`, `/surrender`, `/callvote`, `/vote`, `/poll`, etc.) produce `PlayerOrder` variants and flow through the deterministic order pipeline — they are functionally identical to clicking the GUI button. Commands that affect only the local client (`/volume`, `/shadows`, `/zoom`, `/ui_scale`, etc.) take effect immediately without touching the sim. This distinction mirrors the cvar split: sim-affecting cvars require `DEV_ONLY` or `SERVER` flags and use the order pipeline; client-only cvars are immediate. In multiplayer, sim-affecting commands also respect D033 QoL toggle state — if a toggle is disabled in the lobby, the corresponding console command is rejected. See "Competitive Integrity in Multiplayer" below for the full framework.

**PlayerOrder variant taxonomy:** Commands map to `PlayerOrder` variants as follows:
- **GUI-equivalent commands** (`/move`, `/attack`, `/build`, `/sell`, `/deploy`, `/stance`, `/select`, `/place`, etc.) produce the **same native `PlayerOrder` variant** as their GUI counterpart — e.g., `/move 120,80` produces `PlayerOrder::Move { target: WorldPos(120,80) }`, identical to right-clicking the map.
- **Cvar mutations** (`/set <name> <value>`) produce `PlayerOrder::SetCvar(name, value)` when the cvar has `DEV_ONLY` or `SERVER` flags — these flow through order validation.
- **Cheat codes** (hidden phrases typed in chat) produce `PlayerOrder::CheatCode(CheatId)` — see "Hidden Cheat Codes" below.
- **Chat messages** (`/s`, `/w`, unprefixed text) produce `PlayerOrder::ChatMessage { channel, text }` — see D059 § Text Chat.
- **Coordination actions** (pings, chat wheel, minimap drawing) produce their respective `PlayerOrder` variants (`TacticalPing`, `ChatWheelPhrase`, `MinimapDraw`) — see D059 § Coordination.
- **Meta-commands** (`/help`, `/locale`, `/hotkeys`, `/voice diag`, etc.) are **local-only** — they produce no `PlayerOrder` and never touch the sim.
- **`PlayerOrder::ChatCommand(cmd, args)`** is used only for mod-registered commands that produce custom sim-side effects not covered by a native variant. Engine commands never use `ChatCommand`.

**Game-module registration example (RA1):** The RA1 game module registers all RA1-specific commands during `GameModule::register_commands()`. A Tiberian Dawn module would register similar but distinct commands (e.g., `/sell` exists in both, but `/power_activate` with different superweapon names). A total conversion could register entirely novel commands (`/mutate`, `/terraform`, etc.) using the same `CommandDispatcher` infrastructure. This follows the "game is a mod" principle (13-PHILOSOPHY.md § Principle 4) — the base game uses the same registration API available to external modules.

#### Mod-Registered Commands

Mods register commands via the Lua API (D004) or WASM host functions (D005):

```lua
-- Lua mod registration example
Commands.register("spawn_reinforcements", {
    description = "Spawn reinforcements at a location",
    permission = "host",       -- only host can use
    arguments = {
        { name = "faction", type = "string", suggestions = {"allies", "soviet"} },
        { name = "count",   type = "integer", min = 1, max = 50 },
        { name = "location", type = "position" },
    },
    execute = function(source, args)
        -- Mod logic here
        SpawnReinforcements(args.faction, args.count, args.location)
        return "Spawned " .. args.count .. " " .. args.faction .. " reinforcements"
    end
})
```

**Sandboxing:** Mod commands execute within the same Lua sandbox as mission scripts. A mod command cannot access the filesystem, network, or memory outside its sandbox. The `CommandSource` tracks which mod registered the command — if a mod command crashes or times out, the error is attributed to the mod, not the engine.

**Namespace collision:** Mod commands are prefixed with the mod name by default: a mod named `cool_units` registering `spawn` creates `/cool_units:spawn`. Mods can request unprefixed registration (`/spawn`) but collisions are resolved by load order — last mod wins, with a warning logged. The convention follows Minecraft's `namespace:command` pattern.

#### Anti-Trolling Measures

Chat and commands create trolling surfaces. IC addresses each:

| Trolling Vector                                                            | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chat spam**                                                              | Rate limit: max 5 messages per 3 seconds, relay-enforced (see D059 § Text Chat). Client applies the same limit locally to avoid round-trip rejection. Exceeding the limit queues messages with a cooldown warning. Configurable by server.                                                                                                                                |
| **Chat harassment**                                                        | `/ignore` is client-side and instant. `/mute` is admin-enforced and server-side. Ignored players can't whisper you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Unicode abuse** (oversized chars, RTL overrides, invisible chars, zalgo) | Chat input is sanitized **before** order injection: strip control characters, normalize Unicode to NFC, cap display width. Normalization happens on the sending client before the text enters `PlayerOrder::ChatMessage` — ensuring all clients receive identical normalized bytes (determinism requirement). Homoglyph detection warns admins of impersonation attempts. |
| **Command abuse** (admin runs `/kill` on all players)                      | Admin commands that affect other players are logged as telemetry events (D031). Community server governance (D037) allows reputation consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Lua injection** via chat                                                 | Chat messages never touch the command parser unless they start with `/`. A message like `hello /c game.destroy()` is plain text, not a command. Only the first `/` at position 0 triggers command parsing.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Fake command output**                                                    | System messages (command results, join/leave notifications) use a distinct visual style (color, icon) that players cannot replicate through chat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Command spam**                                                           | Commands have the same rate limit as chat. Dev commands additionally logged with timestamps for abuse review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Programmable spam** (Factorio's speaker problem)                         | IC doesn't have programmable speakers, but any future mod-driven notification system should respect the same per-player mute controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Achievement and Ranking Interaction

Following the universal convention (Factorio, AoE, OpenRA):

- **Using any dev command permanently flags the match/save** as using cheats. This is recorded in the replay metadata and sim state.
- **Flagged games cannot count toward ranked matchmaking (D055)** or achievements (D036).
- **The flag is irreversible** for that save/match — even if you toggle dev mode off.
- **Non-dev commands** (`/help`, `/set render.shadows false`, chat, `/ping`) do NOT flag the game. Only commands that affect simulation state through `DevCommand` orders trigger the flag.
- **Saved game cheated flag:** The snapshot (D010) includes `cheats_used: bool` and `cosmetic_cheats_used: bool` fields. Loading a save with `cheats_used = true` displays a permanent "cheats used" indicator and disables achievements. Loading a save with only `cosmetic_cheats_used = true` displays a subtle "cosmetic mods active" indicator but achievements remain enabled. Both flags are irreversible per save and recorded in replay metadata.

This follows Factorio's model — the Lua console is immensely useful for testing and debugging, but using it has clear consequences for competitive integrity — while refining it with a proportional response: gameplay cheats carry full consequences, cosmetic cheats are recorded but don't punish the player for having fun.

#### Competitive Integrity in Multiplayer

Dev commands and cheat codes are handled. But what about the ~120 *normal* commands available to every player in multiplayer — `/move`, `/attack`, `/build`, `/select`, `/place`? These produce the same `PlayerOrder` variants as clicking the GUI, but they make external automation trivially easy. A script that sends `/select idle` → `/build harvester` → `/rally 120,80` every 3 seconds is functionally a perfect macro player. Does this create an unfair advantage for scripters?

##### The Open-Source Competitive Dilemma

This section documents a fundamental, irreconcilable tension that shapes every competitive integrity decision in IC. It is written as a permanent reference for future contributors, so the reasoning does not need to be re-derived.

**The dilemma in one sentence:** An open-source game engine cannot prevent client-side cheating, but a competitive community demands competitive integrity.

In a closed-source game (StarCraft 2, CS2, Valorant), the developer controls the client binary. They can:
- Obfuscate the protocol and memory layout so reverse-engineering is expensive
- Deploy kernel-level anti-cheat (Warden, VAC, Vanguard) to detect modified clients
- Ban players whose clients fail integrity checks
- Update obfuscation faster than hackers can reverse-engineer

**What commercial anti-cheat products actually do:**

| **VAC** (Valve Anti-Cheat)    | Memory scanning + process hashing                  | Scans client RAM for known cheat signatures; hashes game binaries to detect tampering; delayed bans to obscure detection vectors                               | Source is public — cheaters know exactly what memory layouts to avoid. Binary hashing is meaningless when every user compiles from source. Delayed bans rely on secrecy of detection methods; GPL eliminates that secrecy.                                                                                                                                                               |

Client file hashing fails when users compile their own binaries.

| **EAC / BattlEye**            | Kernel-mode driver (ring-0)                        | Loads a kernel driver at boot that monitors all system calls, blocks known cheat tools from loading, detects memory manipulation from outside the game process | Kernel drivers are incompatible with Linux (where they'd need custom kernel modules), impossible on WASM, antithetical to user trust in open-source software, and unenforceable when users can simply remove the driver from source and recompile. Ring-0 access also creates security liability — EAC and BattlEye vulnerabilities have been exploited as privilege escalation vectors. |
| **Vanguard** (Riot Games)     | Always-on kernel driver + client integrity         | Runs from system boot (not just during gameplay); deep system introspection; hardware fingerprinting; client binary attestation                                | The most invasive model — requires the developer to be more trusted than the user's OS. Fundamentally incompatible with GPL's guarantee that users control their own software. Also requires a dedicated security team maintaining driver compatibility across OS versions — organizations like Riot spend millions annually on this infrastructure.                                     |

The common thread: every commercial anti-cheat product depends on **information asymmetry** (the developer knows things the cheater doesn't) or **privilege asymmetry** (the anti-cheat has deeper system access than the cheat). GPL v3 eliminates both. The source code is public. The user controls the binary. These are features, not flaws — but they make client-side anti-cheat a solved impossibility.

None of these are available to IC:
- The engine is GPL v3 (D051). The source code is public. There is nothing to reverse-engineer — anyone can read the protocol, the order format, and the sim logic directly.
- Kernel-level anti-cheat is antithetical to GPL, Linux support, user privacy, and community trust. It is also unenforceable when users can compile their own client.
- Client integrity checks are meaningless when the "legitimate" client is whatever the user compiled from source.
- Obfuscation is impossible — the source repository IS the documentation.

**What a malicious player can do** (and no client-side measure can prevent):
- Read the source to understand exactly what `PlayerOrder` variants exist and what the sim accepts
- Build a modified client that sends orders directly to the relay server, bypassing all GUI and console input
- Fake any `CommandOrigin` tag (`Keybinding`, `MouseClick`) to disguise scripted input as human
- Automate any action the game allows: perfect split micro, instant building placement, zero-delay production cycling
- Implement maphack if fog-of-war is client-side (which is why fog-authoritative mode via the relay is critical — see `06-SECURITY.md`)

**What a malicious player cannot do** (architectural defenses that work regardless of client modification):
- Send orders that fail validation (D012). The sim rejects invalid orders deterministically — every client agrees on the rejection. Modified clients can send orders faster, but they can't send orders the sim wouldn't accept from any client.
- Spoof their order volume at the relay server (D007). The relay counts orders per player per tick server-side. A modified client can lie about `CommandOrigin`, but it can't hide the fact that it sent 500 orders in one tick.
- Avoid replay evidence. Every order, every tick, is recorded in the deterministic replay (D010). Post-match analysis can detect inhuman patterns regardless of what the client reported as its input source.
- Bypass server-side fog-authoritative mode. When enabled, the relay only forwards entity data within each player's vision — the client physically doesn't receive information about units it shouldn't see.

**The resolution — what IC chooses:**

IC does not fight this arms race. Instead, it adopts a four-part strategy modeled on the most successful open-source competitive platforms (Lichess, FAF, DDNet):

1. **Architectural defense.** Make cheating impossible where we can (order validation, relay integrity, fog authority) rather than improbable (obfuscation, anti-tamper). These defenses work even against a fully modified client.
2. **Equalization through features.** When automation provides an advantage, build it into the game as a D033 QoL toggle available to everyone. The script advantage disappears when everyone has the feature.
3. **Total transparency.** Record everything. Expose everything. Every order, every input source, every APM metric, every active script — in the replay and in the lobby. Make scripting visible, not secret.
4. **Community governance.** Let communities enforce their own competitive norms (D037, D052). Engine-enforced rules are minimal and architectural. Social rules — what level of automation is acceptable, what APM patterns trigger investigation — belong to the community.

This is the Lichess model applied to RTS. Lichess is fully open-source, cannot prevent engine-assisted play through client-side measures, and is the most successful competitive gaming platform in its genre. Its defense is behavioral analysis (Irwin + Kaladin AI systems), statistical pattern matching, community reporting, and permanent reputation consequences — not client-side policing. IC adapts this approach for real-time strategy: server-side order analysis replaces move-time analysis, APM patterns replace centipawn-loss metrics, and replay review replaces PGN review. See `research/minetest-lichess-analysis.md` § Lichess for detailed analysis of Lichess's anti-cheat architecture.

**Why documenting this matters:** Without this explicit rationale, future contributors will periodically propose "just add anti-cheat" or "just disable the console in ranked" or "just detect scripts." These proposals are not wrong because they're technically difficult — they're wrong because they're architecturally impossible in an open-source engine and create a false sense of security that is worse than no protection at all. This dilemma is settled. The resolution is the six principles below.

IC's WASM capability model is architecturally stronger (capabilities are enforced, not requested), but the flag-based transparency is a good UX pattern                   |

**The lesson across all of these:** The most successful approach is the Factorio/FAF/Lichess model — build the automation people want INTO the game as features available to everyone, make all actions transparent and auditable, and let communities enforce their own competitive norms. The open-source projects (Lichess, FAF, DDNet, Minetest) all converge on the same insight: **you cannot secure the client, so secure the server and empower the community.**

##### IC's Competitive Integrity Principles

**CI-1: Console = GUI parity, never superiority.**

Every console command must produce exactly the same `PlayerOrder` as its GUI equivalent. No command may provide capability that the GUI doesn't offer. This is already the design (noted at the end of the Command Catalog) — this principle makes it an explicit invariant.

Specific implications:
- `/select all` selects everything in the current **screen viewport**, matching box-select behavior — NOT all units globally, unless the player has them in a control group (which the GUI also supports via D033's `control_group_limit`).
- `/build <type> inf` (infinite queue) is only available when D033's `multi_queue` toggle is enabled in the lobby. If the lobby uses the vanilla preset (`multi_queue: false`), infinite queuing is rejected.
- `/attack <x,y>` (attack-move) is only available when D033's `attack_move` toggle is enabled. A vanilla preset lobby rejects it.
- Every console command respects the D033 QoL toggle state. **The console is an alternative input method, not a QoL override.**

**CI-2: D033 QoL toggles govern console commands.**

Console commands are bound by the same lobby-agreed QoL configuration as GUI actions. When a D033 toggle is disabled:
- The corresponding console command is rejected with: `"[feature] is disabled in this lobby's rule set."`
- The command does not produce a `PlayerOrder`. It is rejected at the command dispatcher layer, before reaching the order pipeline.
- The help text for disabled commands shows their disabled status: `"/attack — Attack-move to position [DISABLED: attack_move toggle off]"`.

This ensures the console cannot bypass lobby agreements. If the lobby chose the vanilla preset, console users get the vanilla feature set.

**CI-3: Order rate monitoring, not blocking.**

Hard-blocking input rates punishes legitimately fast players (competitive RTS players regularly exceed 300 APM). Instead, IC monitors and exposes:

- **Orders-per-tick tracking.** The sim records orders-per-tick per player in replay metadata. This is always recorded, not opt-in.
- **Input source tagging.** Each `PlayerOrder` in the replay includes an `InputSource` tag: `Keybinding`, `MouseClick`, `ChatCommand`, `ConfigFile`, `Script`, `Touch`, `Controller`. A player issuing 300 orders/minute via `Keybinding` and `MouseClick` is playing fast. A player issuing 300 orders/minute via `ChatCommand` or `Script` is scripting. Note: `InputSource` is client-reported and advisory only — see the `InputSource` enum definition above.
- **APM display.** Observers and replay viewers see per-player APM, broken down by input source. This is standard competitive RTS practice (SC2, AoE2, OpenRA all display APM).
- **Community-configurable thresholds.** Community servers (D052) can define APM alerts or investigation triggers for ranked play. The engine does not hard-enforce these — communities set their own competitive norms. A community that values APM skill sets no cap. A community that values strategy over speed sets a 200 APM soft cap with admin review.

**Why not hard-block:** In an open-source engine, a modified client can send orders with any `CommandOrigin` tag — faking `Keybinding` when actually scripted. Hard-blocking based on unverifiable client-reported data gives a false sense of security. The relay server (D007) can count order volume server-side (where it can't be spoofed), but the input source tag is client-reported and advisory only.

**Note on V17 transport-layer caps:** The `ProtocolLimits` hard ceilings (256 orders/tick, 4 KB/order — see `06-SECURITY.md` § V17) still apply as anti-flooding protection at the relay layer. These are not APM caps — they're DoS prevention. Normal RTS play peaks at 5–10 orders/tick even at professional APM levels, so the 256/tick ceiling is never reached by legitimate play. The distinction: V17 prevents network flooding (relay-enforced, spoofing-proof); Principle 3 here addresses *gameplay* APM policy (community-governed, not engine-enforced).

**CI-4: Automate the thing, not the workaround.**

When the community discovers that a script provides an advantage, the correct response is not to ban the script — it's to build the scripted behavior into the game as a D033 QoL toggle, making it available to everyone with a single checkbox in the lobby settings. Not buried in a config file. Not requiring a Workshop download. Not needing technical knowledge. **A toggle in the settings menu that any player can find and enable.**

This is the most important competitive integrity principle for an open-source engine: **if someone has to script it, the game's UX has failed.** Every popular script is evidence of a feature the game should have provided natively. The script author identified a need; the game should absorb the solution.

The AoE2 DE lesson is the clearest example: auto-reseed farms were a popular mod/script for years. Players who knew about it had an economic advantage — their farms never went idle. Players who didn't know the script existed fell behind. Forgotten Empires eventually built it into the game as a toggle. Controversy faded immediately. Everyone uses it now. The automation advantage disappeared because it stopped being an advantage — it became a baseline feature.

This principle applies proactively, not just reactively:

**Reactive (minimum):** When a Workshop script becomes popular, evaluate it for D033 promotion. The criteria: (a) widely used by script authors, (b) not controversial when available to everyone, (c) reduces tedious repetition without removing strategic decision-making. D037's governance process (community RFCs) is the mechanism.

**Proactive (better):** When designing any system, ask: "will players script this?" If the answer is yes — if there's a repetitive task that rewards automation — build the automation in from the start. Don't wait for the scripting community to solve it. Design the feature with a D033 toggle so lobbies can enable or disable it as they see fit.

Examples of automation candidates for IC:
- **Auto-harvest:** Idle harvesters automatically return to the nearest ore field → D033 toggle `auto_harvest`. Without this, scripts that re-dispatch idle harvesters provide a measurable economic advantage. With the toggle, every player gets perfect harvester management.
- **Auto-repair:** Damaged buildings near repair facilities automatically start repairing → D033 toggle `auto_repair`. Eliminates the tedious click-each-damaged-building loop that scripts handle perfectly.
- **Production auto-repeat:** Re-queue the last built unit type automatically → D033 toggle `production_repeat`. Prevents the "forgot to queue another tank" problem that scripts never have.
- **Idle unit alert:** Notification when production buildings have been idle for N seconds → D033 toggle `idle_alert`. A script can monitor every building simultaneously; a player can't. The alert makes the information accessible to everyone.
- **Smart rally:** Rally points that automatically assign new units to the nearest control group → D033 toggle `smart_rally`. Avoids the need for scripts that intercept newly produced units.

These are NOT currently in D033's catalog — they are examples of both the reactive adoption process and the proactive design mindset. The game should be designed so that someone who has never heard of console scripts or the Workshop has the same access to automation as someone who writes custom `.iccmd` files.

**The accessibility test:** For any automation feature, ask: "Can a player who doesn't know what a script is get this benefit?" If the answer is no — if the only path to the automation is technical knowledge — the game has created an unfair advantage that favors technical literacy over strategic skill. IC should always be moving toward yes.

**CI-5: If you can't beat them, host them.**

Console scripts are shareable on the Workshop (D030) as a first-class resource category. Not reluctantly tolerated — actively supported with the same publishing, versioning, dependency, and discovery infrastructure as maps, mods, and music.

The reasoning is simple: players WILL write automation scripts. In a closed-source engine, that happens underground — in forums, Discord servers, private AutoHotKey configs. The developers can't see what's being shared, can't ensure quality or safety, can't help users find good scripts, and can't detect which automations are becoming standard practice. In an open-source engine, the underground is even more pointless — anyone can read the source and write a script trivially.

So instead of pretending scripts don't exist, IC makes them a Workshop resource:

- **Published scripts are visible.** The development team (and community) can see which automations are popular — direct signal for which behaviors to promote to D033 QoL toggles.
- **Published scripts are versioned.** When the engine updates, script authors can update their packages. Users get notified of compatibility issues.
- **Published scripts are sandboxed.** Workshop console scripts are sequences of console commands (`.iccmd` files), not arbitrary executables. They run through the same `CommandDispatcher` — they can't do anything the console can't do. They're macros, not programs.
- **Published scripts are rated and reviewed.** Community quality filtering applies — same as maps, mods, and balance presets.
- **Published scripts carry lobby disclosure.** In multiplayer, active Workshop scripts are listed in the lobby alongside active mods. All players see what automations each player is running. This is the FAF model — UI mods are visible to all players in the lobby.
- **Published scripts respect D033 toggles.** A script that issues `/attack` commands is rejected in a vanilla-preset lobby where `attack_move` is disabled — just like typing the command manually.

**Script format — `.iccmd` files:**

```
# auto-harvest.iccmd — Auto-queue harvesters when income drops
# Workshop: community/auto-harvest@1.0.0
# Category: Script Libraries > Economy Automation
# Lobby visibility: shown as active script to all players

@on income_below 500
  /select type:war_factory idle
  /build harvester 1
@end

@on building_idle war_factory 10s
  /build harvester 1
@end
```

The `.iccmd` format is deliberately limited — event triggers + console commands, not a programming language. Complex automation belongs in Lua mods (D004), not console scripts. **Boundary with Lua:** `.iccmd` triggers are pre-defined patterns (event name + threshold), not arbitrary conditionals. If a script needs `if/else`, loops, variables, or access to game state beyond trigger parameters, it should be a Lua mod. The triggers shown above (`@on income_below`, `@on building_idle`) are the *ceiling* of `.iccmd` expressiveness — they fire when a named condition crosses a threshold, nothing more. Event triggers must have a per-trigger cooldown (minimum interval between firings) to prevent rapid-fire order generation — without cooldowns, a trigger that fires every tick could consume the player's entire order budget (V17: 256 orders/tick hard ceiling) and crowd out intentional commands. The format details are illustrative — final syntax is a Phase 5+ design task.

**The promotion pipeline:** Workshop script popularity directly feeds the D033 adoption process:

1. **Community creates** — someone publishes `auto-harvest.iccmd` on the Workshop
2. **Community adopts** — it becomes the most-downloaded script in its category
3. **Community discusses** — D037 RFC: "should auto-harvest be a built-in QoL toggle?"
4. **Design team evaluates** — does it reduce tedium without removing decisions?
5. **Engine absorbs** — if yes, it becomes `D033 toggle auto_harvest`, the Workshop script becomes redundant, and the community moves on to the next automation frontier

This is how healthy open-source ecosystems work. npm packages become Node.js built-ins. Popular Vim plugins become Neovim defaults. Community Firefox extensions become browser features. The Workshop is IC's proving ground for automation features.

**CI-6: Transparency over restriction.**

Every action a player takes is recorded in the replay — including the commands they used and their input source. The community can see exactly how each player played. This is the most powerful competitive integrity tool available to an open-source project:

- Post-match replays show full APM breakdown with input source tags
- Tournament casters can display "console commands used" alongside APM
- Community server admins can review flagged matches
- The community decides what level of automation is acceptable for their competitive scene

This mirrors how chess handles engine cheating online: no client can be fully trusted, so the detection is behavioral/statistical, reviewed by humans or automated analysis, and enforced by the community.

##### Player Transparency — What Players See

Principle 6 states transparency over restriction. This subsection specifies exactly what players see — the concrete UX that makes automation visible rather than hidden.

**Lobby (pre-game):**

| Element                     | Visibility                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active mods**             | All loaded mods listed per player (name + version). Mismatches highlighted. Same model as Factorio/FAF            |
| **Active `.iccmd` scripts** | Workshop scripts listed by name with link to Workshop page. Custom (non-Workshop) scripts show "Local script"     |
| **QoL preset**              | Player's active experience profile (D033) displayed — e.g., "OpenRA Purist," "IC Standard," or custom             |
| **D033 toggles summary**    | Expandable panel: which automations are enabled (auto-harvest, auto-repair, production repeat, idle alerts, etc.) |
| **Input devices**           | Not shown — input hardware is private. Only the *commands issued* are tracked, not the device                     |

The lobby is the first line of defense against surprise: if your opponent has auto-repair and production repeat enabled, you see that *before* clicking Ready. This is the FAF model — every UI mod is listed in the lobby, and opponents can inspect the full list.

**In-game HUD:**

- **No real-time script indicators for opponents.** Showing "Player 2 is using a script" mid-game would be distracting, potentially misleading (is auto-harvest a "script" or a QoL toggle?), and would create incentive to game the indicator. The lobby disclosure is sufficient.
- **Own-player indicators:** Your own enabled automations appear as small icons near the minimap (same UI surface as stance icons). You see what *you* have active, always.
- **Observer/caster mode:** Observers and casters see a per-player APM counter with source breakdown (GUI clicks vs. console commands vs. script-issued orders). This is a spectating feature, not a player-facing one — competitive players don't get distracted, but casters can narrate automation differences.

**Post-match score screen:**

| Metric                      | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **APM (total)**             | Raw actions per minute, standard RTS metric                                                     |
| **APM by source**           | Breakdown: GUI / console / `.iccmd` script / config file. Shows how each player issued orders   |
| **D033 toggles active**     | Which automations were enabled during the match                                                 |
| **Workshop scripts active** | Named list of `.iccmd` scripts used, with Workshop links                                        |
| **Order volume graph**      | Timeline of orders-per-second, color-coded by source — spikes from scripts are visually obvious |

The post-match screen answers "how did they play?" without judgment. A player who used auto-repair and a build-order script can be distinguished from one who micro'd everything manually — but neither is labeled "cheater." The community decides what level of automation they respect.

**Replay viewer:**

- Full command log with `CommandOrigin` tags (GUI, Console, Script, ConfigFile)
- APM timeline graph with source-coded coloring
- Script execution markers on the timeline (when each `.iccmd` trigger fired)
- Exportable match data (JSON/CSV) for community statistical analysis tools
- Same observer APM overlay available during replay playback

**Why no "script detected" warnings?**

The user asked: "should we do something to let players know scripts are in use?" The answer is: yes — *before the game starts* (lobby) and *after it ends* (score screen, replay), but *not during the game*. Mid-game warnings create three problems:

1. **Classification ambiguity.** Where is the line between "D033 QoL toggle" and "script"? Auto-harvest is engine-native. A `.iccmd` that does the same thing is functionally identical. Warning about one but not the other is arbitrary.
2. **False security.** A warning that says "no scripts detected" when running an open-source client is meaningless — any modified client can suppress the flag. The lobby disclosure is opt-in honesty backed by replay verification, not a trust claim.
3. **Distraction.** Players should focus on playing, not monitoring opponent automation status. Post-match review is the right time for analysis.

**Lessons from open-source games on client trust:**

The comparison table above includes Lichess, DDNet, and Minetest. The cross-cutting lesson from all open-source competitive games:

- **You cannot secure the client.** Any GPL codebase can be modified to lie about anything client-side. Lichess knows this — their entire anti-cheat (Irwin + Kaladin) is server-side behavioral analysis. DDNet's antibot plugin runs server-side. Minetest's CSM restriction flags are server-enforced.
- **Embrace the openness.** Rather than fighting modifications, make the *legitimate* automation excellent so there's no incentive to use shady external tools. Factorio's mod system is so good that cheating is culturally irrelevant. FAF's sim mod system is so transparent that the community self-polices.
- **The server is the only trust boundary.** Order validation (D012), relay-side order counting (D007), and replay signing (D052) are the real anti-cheat. Client-side anything is theater.

IC's position: we don't pretend the client is trustworthy. We make automation visible, accessible, and community-governed — then let the server and the replay be the source of truth.

##### Ranked Mode Restrictions

Ranked matchmaking (D055) enforces additional constraints beyond casual play:

- **DeveloperMode is unavailable.** The lobby option is hidden in ranked queue — dev commands cannot be enabled.
- **Mod commands require ranked certification.** Community servers (D052) maintain a whitelist of mod commands approved for ranked play. Uncertified mod commands are rejected in ranked matches. The default: only engine-core commands are permitted; game-module commands (those registered by the built-in game module, e.g., RA1) are permitted; third-party mod commands require explicit whitelist entry.
- **Order volume is recorded server-side.** The relay server counts orders per player per tick. This data is included in match certification (D055) and available for community review. It cannot be spoofed by modified clients.
- **`autoexec.cfg` commands execute normally.** Cvar-setting commands (`/set`, `/get`, `/toggle`) from autoexec execute as preferences. Gameplay commands (`/build`, `/move`, etc.) from autoexec are rejected in ranked — `CommandOrigin::ConfigFile` is not a valid origin for sim-affecting orders in ranked mode. You can set your sensitivity in autoexec; you can't script your build order.
- **Zoom range is clamped.** The competitive zoom range (default: 0.75–2.0) overrides the render mode's `CameraConfig.zoom_min/zoom_max` (see `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Camera System") in ranked matches. This prevents extreme zoom-out from providing disproportionate map awareness. The default range is configured per ranked queue by the competitive committee (D037) and stored in the seasonal ranked configuration YAML. Tournament organizers can set their own zoom range via `TournamentConfig`. The `/zoom` command respects these bounds.

##### Tournament Mode

Tournament organizers (via community server administration, D052) can enable a stricter **tournament mode** in the lobby:

| Restriction                         | Effect                                                                                    | Rationale                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command whitelist**               | Only whitelisted commands accepted; all others rejected                                   | Organizers control exactly which console commands are legal                                        |
| **ConfigFile gameplay rejection**   | `autoexec.cfg` sim-affecting commands rejected (same as ranked)                           | Level playing field — no pre-scripted build orders                                                 |
| **Input source logging**            | All `CommandOrigin` tags recorded in match data, visible to admins                        | Post-match review for scripting investigation                                                      |
| **APM cap (optional)**              | Configurable orders-per-minute soft cap; exceeding triggers admin alert, not hard block   | Communities that value strategy over APM can set limits                                            |
| **Forced replay recording**         | Match replay saved automatically; both players receive copies                             | Evidence for dispute resolution                                                                    |
| **No mod commands**                 | Third-party mod commands disabled entirely                                                | Pure vanilla/IC experience for competition                                                         |
| **Workshop scripts (configurable)** | Organizer chooses: allow all, whitelist specific scripts, or disable all `.iccmd` scripts | Some tournaments embrace automation (FAF-style); others require pure manual play. Organizer's call |

Tournament mode is a superset of ranked restrictions — it's ranked plus organizer-defined rules. The `CommandDispatcher` checks a `TournamentConfig` resource (if present) before executing any command.

| Additional Tournament Option | Effect                                          | Default                   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Zoom range override**      | Custom min/max zoom bounds                      | Same as ranked (0.75–2.0) |
| **Resolution cap**           | Maximum horizontal resolution for game viewport | Disabled (no cap)         |
| **Weather sim effects**      | Force `sim_effects: false` on all maps          | Off (use map's setting)   |

##### Visual Settings & Competitive Fairness

Client-side visual settings — `/weather_fx`, `/shadows`, graphics quality presets, and render quality tiers — can affect battlefield visibility. A player who disables weather particles sees more clearly during a storm; a player on Low shadows has cleaner unit silhouettes.

This is a **conscious design choice, not an oversight.** Nearly every competitive game exhibits this pattern: CS2 players play on low settings for visibility, SC2 players minimize effects for performance. The access is symmetric (every player can toggle the same settings), the tradeoff is aesthetics vs. clarity, and restricting visual preferences would be hostile to players on lower-end hardware who *need* reduced effects to maintain playable frame rates.

**Resolution and aspect ratio** follow the same principle. A 32:9 ultrawide player sees more horizontal area than a 16:9 player. In an isometric RTS, this advantage is modest — the sidebar and minimap consume significant screen space, and the critical information (unit positions, fog of war) is available to all players via the minimap regardless of viewport size. Restricting resolution would punish players for their hardware. Tournament organizers can set resolution caps via `TournamentConfig` if their ruleset demands hardware parity, but engine-level ranked play does not restrict this.

**Principle:** Visual settings that are universally accessible, symmetrically available, and involve a meaningful aesthetic tradeoff are not restricted. Settings that provide information not available to other players (hypothetical: a shader that reveals cloaked units) would be restricted. The line is **information equivalence**, not visual equivalence.

##### What We Explicitly Do NOT Do

- **No kernel anti-cheat.** Warden, VAC, Vanguard, EasyAntiCheat — none of these are compatible with GPL, Linux, community trust, or open-source principles. We accept that the client cannot be trusted and design our competitive integrity around server-side verification and community governance instead.
- **No hard APM cap for all players.** Fast players exist. Punishing speed punishes skill. APM is monitored and exposed, not limited (except in tournament mode where organizers opt in).
- **No "you used the console, achievements disabled" for non-dev commands.** Typing `/move 100,200` instead of right-clicking is a UX preference, not cheating. Only dev commands trigger the cheat flag.
- **No script detection heuristics in the engine.** Attempting to distinguish "human typing fast" from "script typing" is an arms race the open-source side always loses. Detection belongs to the community layer (replay review, statistical analysis), not the engine layer.
- **No removal of the console in multiplayer.** The console is an accessibility and power-user feature. Removing it doesn't prevent scripting (external tools exist); it just removes a legitimate interface. The answer to automation isn't removing tools — it's making the automation available to everyone (D033) and transparent to the community (replays).

##### Cross-Reference Summary

- **D012 (Order Validation):** The architectural defense — every `PlayerOrder` is validated by the sim regardless of origin. Invalid orders are rejected deterministically.
- **D007 (Relay Server):** Server-side order counting cannot be spoofed by modified clients. The relay sees the real order volume.
- **D030 (Workshop):** Console scripts are a first-class Workshop resource category. Visibility, versioning, and community review make underground scripting unnecessary. Popular scripts feed the D033 promotion pipeline.
- **D033 (QoL Toggles):** The great equalizer — when automation becomes standard community practice, promote it to a QoL toggle so everyone benefits equally. Workshop script popularity is the primary signal for which automations to promote.
- **D037 (Community Governance):** Communities define their own competitive norms via RFCs. APM policies, script policies, and tournament rules are community decisions, not engine-enforced mandates.
- **D052 (Community Servers):** Server operators configure ranked restrictions, tournament mode, and mod command whitelists.
- **D055 (Ranked Tiers):** Ranked mode automatically applies the competitive integrity restrictions described above.
- **D048 (Render Modes):** Information equivalence guarantee — all render modes display identical game-state information. See D048 § "Information Equivalence Across Render Modes."
- **D022 (Weather):** Weather sim effects on ranked maps are a map pool curation concern — see D055 § "Map pool curation guidelines."
- **D018 (Experience Profiles):** Profile locking table specifies which axes are fixed in ranked. See D018 § profile locking table.

#### Classic Cheat Codes (Single-Player Easter Egg)

**Phase:** Phase 3+ (requires command system; trivial to implement once `CheatCodeHandler` and `PlayerOrder::CheatCode` exist — each cheat reuses existing dev command effects).

A hidden, undocumented homage to the golden age of cheat codes and trainers. In single-player, the player can type certain phrases into the chat input — no `/` prefix needed — and trigger hidden effects. These are never listed in `/help`, never mentioned in any in-game documentation, and never exposed through the UI. They exist for the community to discover, share, and enjoy — exactly like AoE2's "how do you turn this on" or StarCraft's "power overwhelming."

**Design principles:**

1. **Single-player only.** Cheat phrases are ignored entirely in multiplayer — the `CheatCodeHandler` is not even registered as a system when `NetworkModel` is anything other than `LocalNetwork`. No server-side processing, no network traffic, no possibility of multiplayer exploitation.

2. **Undocumented.** Not in `/help`. Not in the encyclopedia. Not in any in-game tooltip or tutorial. The game's official documentation does not acknowledge their existence. Community wikis and word-of-mouth are the discovery mechanism — just like the originals.

3. **Hashed, not plaintext.** Cheat phrase strings are stored as pre-computed hashes in the binary, not as plaintext string literals. Casual inspection of the binary or source code does not trivially reveal all cheats. This is a speed bump, not cryptographic security — determined data-miners will find them, and that's fine. The goal is to preserve the discovery experience, not to make them impossible to find.

4. **Two-tier achievement-flagging.** Not all cheats are equal — disco palette cycling doesn't affect competitive integrity the same way infinite credits does. IC uses a two-tier cheat classification:

   - **Gameplay cheats** (invincibility, instant build, free credits, reveal map, etc.) permanently set `cheats_used = true` on the save/match. Achievements (D036) are disabled. Same rules as dev commands.
   - **Cosmetic cheats** (palette effects, visual gags, camera tricks, audio swaps) set `cosmetic_cheats_used = true` but do NOT disable achievements or flag the save as "cheated." They are recorded in replay metadata for transparency but carry no competitive consequence.

   The litmus test: **does this cheat change the simulation state in a way that affects win/loss outcomes?** If yes → gameplay cheat. If it only touches rendering, audio, or visual effects with zero sim impact → cosmetic cheat. Edge cases default to gameplay (conservative). The classification is per-cheat, defined in the game module's cheat table (the `CheatFlags` field below).

   This is more honest than a blanket flag. Punishing a player for typing "kilroy was here" the same way you punish them for infinite credits is disproportionate — it discourages the fun, low-stakes cheats that are the whole point of the system.

5. **Thematic.** Phrases are Cold War themed, fitting the Red Alert setting, and extend to C&C franchise cultural moments and cross-game nostalgia. Each cheat has a brief, in-character confirmation message displayed as an EVA notification — no generic "cheat activated" text. Naming follows the narrative identity principle: earnest commitment, never ironic distance (Principle #20, [13-PHILOSOPHY.md](13-PHILOSOPHY.md)). Even hidden mechanisms carry the world's flavor.

6. **Fun first.** Some cheats are practical (infinite credits, invincibility). Others are purely cosmetic silliness (visual effects, silly unit behavior). The two-tier flagging (principle 4 above) ensures cosmetic cheats don't carry disproportionate consequences — players can enjoy visual gags without losing achievement progress.

**Implementation:**

```rust
/// Handles hidden cheat code activation in single-player.
/// Registered ONLY when NetworkModel is LocalNetwork (single-player / skirmish vs AI).
/// Checked BEFORE the CommandDispatcher — if input matches a known cheat hash,
/// the cheat is activated and the input is consumed (never reaches chat or command parser).
pub struct CheatCodeHandler {
    /// Pre-computed FNV-1a hashes of cheat phrases (lowercased, trimmed).
    /// Using hashes instead of plaintext prevents casual string extraction from the binary.
    /// Map: hash → CheatEntry (id + flags).
    known_hashes: HashMap<u64, CheatEntry>,
    /// Currently active toggle cheats (invincibility, instant build, etc.).
    active_toggles: HashSet<CheatId>,
}

pub struct CheatEntry {
    pub id: CheatId,
    pub flags: CheatFlags,
}

bitflags! {
    /// Per-cheat classification. Determines achievement/ranking consequences.
    pub struct CheatFlags: u8 {
        /// Affects simulation state (credits, health, production, fog, victory).
        /// Sets `cheats_used = true` — disables achievements and ranked submission.
        const GAMEPLAY = 0b01;
        /// Affects only rendering, audio, or camera — zero sim impact.
        /// Sets `cosmetic_cheats_used = true` — recorded in replay but no competitive consequence.
        const COSMETIC = 0b10;
    }
}

impl CheatCodeHandler {
    /// Called from InputSource processing pipeline, BEFORE command dispatch.
    /// Returns true if input was consumed as a cheat code.
    pub fn try_activate(&mut self, input: &str) -> Option<CheatActivation> {
        let normalized = input.trim().to_lowercase();
        let hash = fnv1a_hash(normalized.as_bytes());
        if let Some(&cheat_id) = self.known_hashes.get(&hash) {
            Some(CheatActivation {
                cheat_id,
                // Produces a PlayerOrder::CheatCode(cheat_id) that flows through
                // the sim's order pipeline — deterministic, snapshottable, replayable.
                order: PlayerOrder::CheatCode(cheat_id),
            })
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

/// Cheat activation produces a PlayerOrder — the sim handles it deterministically.
/// This means cheats are: (a) snapshottable (D010), (b) replayable, (c) validated
/// (the sim rejects CheatCode orders when not in single-player mode).
pub enum PlayerOrder {
    // ... existing variants ...
    CheatCode(CheatId),
}
```

**Processing flow:** Chat input → `CheatCodeHandler::try_activate()` → if match, produce `PlayerOrder::CheatCode` → order pipeline → sim validates (single-player only) → check `CheatFlags`: if `GAMEPLAY`, set `cheats_used = true`; if `COSMETIC`, set `cosmetic_cheats_used = true` → apply effect → EVA confirmation notification. If no match, input falls through to normal chat/command dispatch.

**Note on chat swallowing:** If a player types a cheat phrase (e.g., "iron curtain") as normal chat, it is consumed as a cheat activation — the text is NOT sent as a chat message. This is **intentional and by design**: cheat codes only activate in single-player mode (multiplayer rejects `CheatCode` orders), and the hidden-phrase discovery mechanic requires that the input be consumed on match. Players in single-player who accidentally trigger a cheat receive an EVA confirmation that makes the activation obvious, and all cheats are toggleable (can be deactivated by typing the phrase again).

**Why meta-references are `COSMETIC`:** They have zero game effect. The reconnaissance value of knowing "`black sheep wall` doesn't work but `perestroika` does" is part of the discovery fun — the game is training you to find the real cheats. The last two entries deliberately point players toward IC's actual cheat codes, rewarding cross-game knowledge with a hint.

**Mod-defined cheats:** Game modules register their own cheat code tables — the engine provides the `CheatCodeHandler` infrastructure, the game module supplies the phrase hashes and effect implementations. A Tiberian Dawn module would have different themed phrases than RA1. Total conversion mods can define entirely custom cheat tables via YAML:

```yaml
# Custom cheat codes (mod.yaml)
cheat_codes:
  - phrase_hash: 0x7a3f2e1d   # hash of the phrase — not the phrase itself
    effect: give_credits
    amount: 50000
    flags: gameplay          # disables achievements
    confirmation: "Tiberium dividend received."
  - phrase_hash: 0x4b8c9d0e
    effect: toggle_invincible
    flags: gameplay
    confirmation_on: "Blessed by Kane."
    confirmation_off: "Mortality restored."
  - phrase_hash: 0x9e2f1a3b
    effect: toggle_visual
    flags: cosmetic           # achievements unaffected
    confirmation_on: "The world changes."
    confirmation_off: "Reality restored."
```

**Relationship to dev commands:** Cheat codes and dev commands are complementary, not redundant. Dev commands (`/give`, `/spawn`, `/reveal`, `/instant_build`) are the precise, documented, power-user interface — visible in `/help`, discoverable, parameterized. Cheat codes are the thematic, hidden, fun interface — no parameters, no documentation, themed phrases with in-character responses. Under the hood, many cheats produce the same `PlayerOrder` variants as their dev command counterparts. The difference is entirely in the surface: how the player discovers, invokes, and experiences them.

**Why hashed phrases, not encrypted:** We are preserving a nostalgic discovery experience, not implementing DRM. Hashing makes cheats non-obvious to casual inspection but deliberately yields to determined community effort. Within weeks of release, every cheat will be on a wiki — and that's the intended outcome. The joy is in the initial community discovery process, not in permanent secrecy.

| Risk                                    | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arbitrary Lua execution**             | Lua runs in the D004 sandbox — no filesystem, no network, no `os.*`. `loadstring()` disabled. Execution timeout (100ms default). Memory limit per invocation.                                                                                                     |
| **Cvar manipulation for cheating**      | Sim-affecting cvars require `DEV_ONLY` flag and flow through order validation. Render/audio cvars cannot affect gameplay. A `/set` command for a `DEV_ONLY` cvar without dev mode active is rejected.                                                             |
| **Chat message buffer overflow**        | Chat messages are bounded (512 chars, same as `ProtocolLimits::max_chat_message_length` from `06-SECURITY.md` § V15). Command input bounded similarly. The `StringReader` parser rejects input exceeding the limit before parsing.                                |
| **Command injection in multiplayer**    | Commands execute locally on the issuing client. Sim-affecting commands go through the order pipeline as `PlayerOrder::ChatCommand(cmd, args)` — validated by the sim like any other order. A malicious client cannot execute commands on another client's behalf. |
| **Denial of service via expensive Lua** | Lua execution has a tick budget. `/c` commands that exceed the budget are interrupted with an error. The chat/console remains responsive because Lua runs in the script system's time slice, not the UI thread.                                                   |
| **Cvar persistence tampering**          | `config.yaml` is local — tampering only affects the local client. Server-authoritative cvars (`SERVER` flag) cannot be overridden by client-side config.                                                                                                          |

#### Platform Considerations

| Platform             | Chat Input                                 | Developer Console                                                 | Notes                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Desktop**          | Enter opens input, `/` prefix for commands | `~` toggles overlay                                               | Full keyboard; best experience                     |
| **Browser (WASM)**   | Same                                       | Same (tilde might conflict with browser shortcuts — configurable) | Virtual keyboard on mobile browsers                |
| **Steam Deck**       | On-screen keyboard when input focused      | Touchscreen or controller shortcut                                | Steam's built-in OSK works                         |
| **Mobile (future)**  | Tap chat icon → OS keyboard                | Not exposed (use GUI settings instead)                            | Commands via chat input; no tilde console          |
| **Console (future)** | D-pad/bumper to open, OS keyboard          | Not exposed                                                       | Controller-friendly command browser as alternative |

For non-desktop platforms, the cvar browser in the developer console is replaced by the **Settings UI** — a GUI-based equivalent that exposes the same cvars through menus and sliders. The command system is accessible via chat input on all platforms; the developer console overlay is a desktop convenience, not a requirement.

### Config File on Startup

Cvars are loadable from `config.yaml` on startup and optionally from a per-game-module override:

```
config.yaml                  # global defaults
config.ra1.yaml              # RA1-specific overrides (optional)
config.td.yaml               # TD-specific overrides (optional)
```

**Load order:** `config.yaml` → `config.<game_module>.yaml` → command-line arguments → in-game `/set` commands. Each layer overrides the previous. Changes made via `/set` on `PERSISTENT` cvars write back to the appropriate config file.

**Autoexec:** An optional `autoexec.cfg` file (Source Engine convention) runs commands on startup:

```
# autoexec.cfg — runs on game startup
/set render.max_fps 144
/set audio.master_volume 80
/set gameplay.scroll_speed 7
```

This is a convenience for power users who prefer text files over GUI settings. The format is one command per line, `#` for comments. Parsed by the same `CommandDispatcher` with `CommandOrigin::ConfigFile`.

### What This Is NOT

- **NOT a replacement for the Settings UI.** Most players change settings through the GUI. The command system and cvars are the power-user interface to the same underlying settings. Both read and write the same `config.yaml`.
- **NOT a scripting environment.** The `/c` Lua console is for quick testing and debugging, not for writing mods. Mods belong in proper `.lua` files loaded through the mod system (D004). The console is a REPL — one-liners and quick experiments.
- **NOT available in competitive/ranked play.** Dev commands are gated behind DeveloperMode (V44). The chat system and non-dev commands work in ranked; the Lua console and dev commands do not. Normal console commands (`/move`, `/build`, etc.) are treated as GUI-equivalent inputs — they produce the same `PlayerOrder` and are governed by D033 QoL toggles. See "Competitive Integrity in Multiplayer" above for the full framework: order rate monitoring, input source tracking, ranked restrictions, and tournament mode.
- **NOT a server management panel.** Server administration beyond kick/ban/config should use external tools (web panels, RCON protocol). The in-game commands cover in-match operations only.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Separate console only, no chat integration** (rejected — Source Engine's model works for FPS games where chat is secondary, but RTS players use chat heavily during matches; forcing tilde-switch for commands is friction. Factorio and Minecraft prove unified is better for games where chat and commands coexist.)
- **Chat only, no developer console** (rejected — power users need multi-line Lua input, scrollback, cvar browsing, and syntax highlighting. A single-line chat field can't provide this. The developer console is a thin UI layer over the same dispatcher — minimal implementation cost.)
- **GUI-only commands like OpenRA** (rejected — checkbox menus are fine for 7 dev mode flags but don't scale to dozens of commands, mod-injected commands, or Lua execution. A text interface is necessary for extensibility.)
- **Custom command syntax instead of `/` prefix** (rejected — `/` is the universal standard across Minecraft, Factorio, Discord, IRC, MMOs, and dozens of other games. Any other prefix would surprise users.)
- **RCON protocol for remote administration** (deferred — useful for dedicated servers but out of scope for Phase 3. Can be added later as a `CommandOrigin::Rcon` variant with `Admin` permission level. The command dispatcher is origin-agnostic by design.)
- **Unrestricted Lua console without achievement consequences** (rejected — every game that has tried this has created a split community where "did you use the console?" is a constant question. Factorio's model — use it freely, but achievements are permanently disabled — is honest and universally understood.)
- **Disable console commands in multiplayer to prevent scripting** (rejected — console commands produce the same `PlayerOrder` as GUI actions. Removing them doesn't prevent scripting — external tools like AutoHotKey can automate mouse/keyboard input. Worse, a modified open-source client can send orders directly, bypassing all input methods. Removing the console punishes legitimate power users and accessibility needs while providing zero security benefit. The correct defense is D033 equalization, input source tracking, and community governance — see "Competitive Integrity in Multiplayer.")

### Integration with Existing Decisions

- **D004 (Lua Scripting):** The `/c` command executes Lua in the same sandbox as mission scripts. The `CommandSource` passed to Lua commands provides the execution context (`CommandOrigin::ChatInput` vs `LuaScript` vs `ConfigFile`).
- **D005 (WASM):** WASM modules register commands through the same `CommandDispatcher` host function API. WASM commands have the same permission model and sandboxing guarantees.
- **D012 (Order Validation):** Sim-affecting commands produce `PlayerOrder` variants. The order validator rejects dev commands when dev mode is inactive, and logs repeated rejections for anti-cheat analysis.
- **D031 (Observability):** Command execution events (who, what, when) are telemetry events. Admin actions, dev mode usage, and Lua console invocations are all observable.
- **D033 (QoL Toggles):** Many QoL settings map directly to cvars. The QoL toggle UI and the cvar system read/write the same underlying values.
- **D034 (SQLite):** Console command history is persisted in SQLite. The cvar browser's search index uses the same FTS5 infrastructure.
- **D036 (Achievements):** The `cheats_used` flag in sim state is set when any dev command or gameplay cheat executes. Achievement checks respect this flag. Cosmetic cheats (`cosmetic_cheats_used`) do not affect achievements — only `cheats_used` does.
- **D055 (Ranked Matchmaking):** Games with `cheats_used = true` are excluded from ranked submission. The relay server verifies this flag in match certification. `cosmetic_cheats_used` alone does not affect ranked eligibility (cosmetic cheats are single-player only regardless).
- **03-NETCODE.md (In-Match Vote Framework):** The `/callvote`, `/vote`, `/poll` commands are registered in the Brigadier command tree. `/gg` and `/ff` are aliases for `/callvote surrender`. Vote commands produce `PlayerOrder::Vote` variants — processed by the sim like any other order. Tactical polls extend the chat wheel phrase system.
- **V44 (06-SECURITY.md):** `DeveloperMode` is sim state, toggled in lobby only, with unanimous consent in multiplayer. The command system enforces this — dev commands are rejected at the order validation layer, not the UI layer.

| **Driver**     | No open-source RTS has built-in VoIP. OpenRA has no voice chat. The Remastered Collection added basic lobby voice via Steam. This is a major opportunity for IC to set the standard. |

### Problem

RTS multiplayer requires three kinds of player coordination:

1. **Text communication** — chat channels (all, team, whisper), emoji, mod-registered phrases
2. **Voice communication** — push-to-talk VoIP for real-time callouts during gameplay
3. **Spatial signaling** — beacons, pings, map markers, tactical annotations that convey *where* and *what* without words

D058 designed the text input/command system (chat box, `/` prefix routing, command dispatch). What D058 did NOT address:

- Chat **channel routing** — how messages reach the right recipients (all, team, whisper, observers)
- **VoIP architecture** — codec, transport, relay integration, bandwidth management
- **Beacons and pings** — the non-verbal coordination layer that Apex Legends proved is often more effective than voice
- **Voice-in-replay** — whether and how voice recordings are preserved for replay playback
- How all three systems integrate with the existing `MessageLane` infrastructure (`03-NETCODE.md`) and `Transport` trait (D054)

### Decision

Build a unified coordination system with three tiers: text chat channels, relay-forwarded VoIP, and a contextual ping/beacon system — plus novel coordination tools (chat wheel, minimap drawing, tactical markers). Voice is optionally recorded into replays as a separate stream with explicit consent.

### 1. Text Chat — Channel Architecture

D058 defined the chat *input* system. This section defines the chat *routing* system — how messages are delivered to the correct recipients.

#### Channel Model

```rust
/// Chat channel identifiers. Sent as part of every ChatMessage order.
/// The channel determines who receives the message. Channel selection
/// is sticky — the player's last-used channel persists until changed.
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum ChatChannel {
    /// All players and observers see the message.
    All,
    /// Only players on the same team (including shared-control allies).
    Team,
    /// Private message to a specific player. Not visible to others.
    /// Observers cannot whisper to players (anti-coaching, V41).
    Whisper { target: PlayerId },
    /// Observer-only channel. Players do not see these messages.
    /// Prevents spectator coaching during live games (V41).
    Observer,
}
```

#### Chat Message Order

Chat messages flow through the order pipeline — they are `PlayerOrder` variants, validated by the sim (D012), and replayed deterministically:

```rust
/// Chat message as a player order. Part of the deterministic order stream.
/// This means chat is captured in replays and can be replayed alongside
/// gameplay — matching SC2's `replay.message.events` stream.
pub enum PlayerOrder {
    // ... existing variants ...
    ChatMessage {
        channel: ChatChannel,
        /// UTF-8 text, bounded by ProtocolLimits::max_chat_message_length (512 chars, V15).
        text: String,
    },
    /// Notification-only metadata marker: player started/stopped voice transmission.
    /// NOT the audio data itself — that flows outside the order pipeline
    /// via MessageLane::Voice (see D059 § VoIP Architecture). This order exists
    /// solely so the sim can record voice activity timestamps in the replay's
    /// analysis event stream. The sim DOES NOT process, decode, or relay any audio.
    /// "VoIP is not part of the simulation" — VoiceActivity is a timestamp marker,
    /// not audio data.
    VoiceActivity {
        active: bool,
    },
    /// Tactical ping placed on the map. Sim-side so it appears in replays.
    TacticalPing {
        ping_type: PingType,
        pos: WorldPos,
        /// Optional entity target (e.g., "attack this unit").
        target: Option<UnitTag>,
    },
    /// Chat wheel phrase selected. Sim-side for deterministic replay.
    ChatWheelPhrase {
        phrase_id: u16,
    },
    /// Minimap annotation stroke (batch of points). Sim-side for replay.
    MinimapDraw {
        points: Vec<WorldPos>,
        color: PlayerColor,
    },
}
```

**Why chat is in the order stream:** SC2 stores chat in a separate `replay.message.events` stream alongside `replay.game.events` (orders) and `replay.tracker.events` (analysis). IC follows this model — `ChatMessage` orders are part of the tick stream, meaning replays preserve the full text conversation. During replay playback, the chat overlay shows messages at the exact tick they were sent. This is essential for tournament review and community content creation.

#### Channel Routing

Chat routing is a relay server concern, not a sim concern. The relay inspects `ChatChannel` to determine forwarding:

| Channel              | Relay Forwards To                           | Replay Visibility | Notes                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `All`                | All connected clients (players + observers) | Full              | Standard all-chat                                |
| `Team`               | Same-team players only                      | Full (after game) | Hidden from opponents during live game           |
| `Whisper { target }` | Target player only + sender echo            | Sender only       | Private — not in shared replay                   |
| `Observer`           | All observers only                          | Full              | Players never see observer chat during live game |

**Anti-coaching:** During a live game, observer messages are never forwarded to players. This prevents spectator coaching in competitive matches. In replay playback, all channels are visible (the information is historical).

**Chat cooldown:** Rate-limited at the relay: max 5 messages per 3 seconds per player (configurable via server cvar). Exceeding the limit queues messages with a "slow mode" indicator. This prevents chat spam without blocking legitimate rapid communication during intense moments.

#### Channel Switching

```
Enter         → Open chat in last-used channel
Shift+Enter   → Open chat in All (if last-used was Team)
Tab           → Cycle: All → Team → Observer (if spectating)
/w <name>     → Switch to whisper channel targeting <name>
/all           → Switch to All channel (D058 command)
/team          → Switch to Team channel (D058 command)  
```

The active channel is displayed as a colored prefix in the chat input: `[ALL]`, `[TEAM]`, `[WHISPER → Alice]`, `[OBS]`.

#### Emoji and Rich Text

Chat messages support a limited set of inline formatting:

- **Emoji shortcodes** — `:gg:`, `:glhf:`, `:allied:`, `:soviet:` mapped to sprite-based emoji (not Unicode — ensures consistent rendering across platforms). Custom emoji can be registered by mods via YAML.
- **Unit/building links** — `[Tank]` auto-links to the unit's encyclopedia entry (if `ic-ui` has one). Parsed client-side, not in the order stream.
- **No markdown, no HTML, no BBCode.** Chat is plain text with emoji shortcodes. This eliminates an entire class of injection attacks and keeps the parser trivial.

### 2. Voice-over-IP — Architecture

No open-source RTS engine has built-in VoIP. OpenRA relies on Discord/TeamSpeak. The Remastered Collection added lobby voice via Steam's API (Steamworks `ISteamNetworkingMessages`). IC's VoIP is engine-native — no external service dependency.

#### Design Principles

1. **VoIP is NOT part of the simulation.** Voice data never enters `ic-sim`. It is pure I/O — captured, encoded, transmitted, decoded, and played back entirely in `ic-net` and `ic-audio`. The sim is unaware that voice exists (Invariant #1: simulation is pure and deterministic).

2. **Voice flows through the relay.** Not P2P. This maintains D007's architecture: the relay prevents IP exposure, provides consistent routing, and enables server-side mute enforcement. P2P voice would leak player IP addresses — a known harassment vector in competitive games.

3. **Push-to-talk is the default.** Voice activation detection (VAD) is available as an option but not default. PTT prevents accidental transmission of background noise, private conversations, and keyboard/mouse sounds — problems that plague open-mic games.

4. **Voice is best-effort.** Lost voice packets are not retransmitted. Human hearing tolerates ~5% packet loss with Opus's built-in PLC (packet loss concealment). Retransmitting stale voice data adds latency without improving quality.

5. **Voice never delays gameplay.** The `MessageLane::Voice` lane has lower priority than `Orders` and `Control` — voice packets are dropped before order packets under bandwidth pressure.

6. **End-to-end latency target: <150ms.** Mouth-to-ear latency must stay under 150ms for natural conversation. Budget: capture buffer ~5ms + encode ~2ms + network RTT/2 (typically 30-80ms) + jitter buffer (20-60ms) + decode ~1ms + playback buffer ~5ms = 63-153ms. CS2 and Valorant achieve ~100-150ms. Mumble achieves ~50-80ms on LAN, ~100-150ms on WAN. At >200ms, conversation becomes turn-taking rather than natural overlap — unacceptable for real-time RTS callouts. The adaptive jitter buffer (see below) is the primary latency knob: on good networks it stays at 1 frame (20ms); on poor networks it expands up to 10 frames (200ms) as a tradeoff. Monitoring this budget is exposed via `VoiceDiagnostics` (see UI Indicators).

#### Codec: Opus

**Opus** (RFC 6716) is the only viable choice. It is:
- Royalty-free and open-source (BSD license)
- The standard game voice codec (used by Discord, Steam, ioquake3, Mumble, WebRTC)
- Excellent at low bitrates (usable at 6 kbps, good at 16 kbps, transparent at 32 kbps)
- Built-in forward error correction (FEC) and packet loss concealment (PLC)
- Native Rust bindings available via `audiopus` crate (safe wrapper around libopus)

**Encoding parameters:**

| Parameter              | Default  | Range         | Notes                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sample rate            | 48 kHz   | Fixed         | Opus native rate; input is resampled if needed                            |
| Channels               | 1 (mono) | Fixed         | Voice chat is mono; stereo is wasted bandwidth                            |
| Frame size             | 20 ms    | 10, 20, 40 ms | 20 ms is the standard balance of latency vs. overhead                     |
| Bitrate                | 32 kbps  | 8–64 kbps     | Adaptive (see below). 32 kbps matches Discord/Mumble quality expectations |
| Application mode       | `VOIP`   | Fixed         | Opus `OPUS_APPLICATION_VOIP` — optimized for speech, enables DTX          |
| Complexity             | 7        | 0–10          | Mumble uses 10, Discord similar; 7 is quality/CPU sweet spot              |
| DTX (Discontinuous Tx) | Enabled  | On/Off        | Stops transmitting during silence — major bandwidth savings               |
| In-band FEC            | Enabled  | On/Off        | Encodes lower-bitrate redundancy of previous frame — helps packet loss    |
| Packet loss percentage | Dynamic  | 0–100         | Fed from `VoiceBitrateAdapter.loss_ratio` — adapts FEC to actual loss     |

**Bandwidth budget per player:**

| Bitrate | Opus payload/frame (20ms) | + overhead (per packet) | Per second | Quality      |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 8 kbps  | 20 bytes                  | ~48 bytes               | ~2.4 KB/s  | Intelligible |
| 16 kbps | 40 bytes                  | ~68 bytes               | ~3.4 KB/s  | Good         |
| 24 kbps | 60 bytes                  | ~88 bytes               | ~4.4 KB/s  | Very good    |
| 32 kbps | 80 bytes                  | ~108 bytes              | ~5.4 KB/s  | **Default**  |
| 64 kbps | 160 bytes                 | ~188 bytes              | ~9.4 KB/s  | Music-grade  |

Overhead = 28 bytes UDP/IP + lane header. With DTX enabled, actual bandwidth is ~60% of these figures (voice is ~60% activity, ~40% silence in typical conversation). An 8-player game where 2 players speak simultaneously at the default 32 kbps uses 2 × 5.4 KB/s = ~10.8 KB/s inbound — negligible compared to the order stream.

#### Adaptive Bitrate

The relay monitors per-connection bandwidth using the same ack vector RTT measurements used for order delivery (`03-NETCODE.md` § Per-Ack RTT Measurement). When bandwidth is constrained:

```rust
/// Voice bitrate adaptation based on available bandwidth.
/// Runs on the sending client. The relay reports congestion via
/// a VoiceBitrateHint control message (not an order — control lane).
pub struct VoiceBitrateAdapter {
    /// Current target bitrate (Opus encoder parameter).
    pub current_bitrate: u32,
    /// Minimum acceptable bitrate. Below this, voice is suspended
    /// with a "low bandwidth" indicator to the UI.
    pub min_bitrate: u32,       // default: 8_000
    /// Maximum bitrate when bandwidth is plentiful.
    pub max_bitrate: u32,       // default: 32_000
    /// Smoothed trip time from ack vectors (updated every packet).
    pub srtt_us: u64,
    /// Packet loss ratio (0.0–1.0) from ack vector analysis.
    pub loss_ratio: f32,        // f32 OK — this is I/O, not sim
}

impl VoiceBitrateAdapter {
    /// Called each frame. Returns the bitrate to configure on the encoder.
    /// Also updates Opus's OPUS_SET_PACKET_LOSS_PERC hint dynamically
    /// (learned from Mumble/Discord — static loss hints under-optimize FEC).
    pub fn adapt(&mut self) -> u32 {
        if self.loss_ratio > 0.15 {
            // Heavy loss: drop to minimum, prioritize intelligibility
            self.current_bitrate = self.min_bitrate;
        } else if self.loss_ratio > 0.05 {
            // Moderate loss: reduce by 25%
            self.current_bitrate = (self.current_bitrate * 3 / 4).max(self.min_bitrate);
        } else if self.srtt_us < 100_000 {
            // Low latency, low loss: increase toward max
            self.current_bitrate = (self.current_bitrate * 5 / 4).min(self.max_bitrate);
        }
        self.current_bitrate
    }

    /// Returns the packet loss percentage hint for OPUS_SET_PACKET_LOSS_PERC.
    /// Dynamic: fed from observed loss_ratio rather than a static 10% default.
    /// At higher loss hints, Opus allocates more bits to in-band FEC.
    pub fn opus_loss_hint(&self) -> i32 {
        // Quantize to 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 — Opus doesn't need fine granularity
        ((self.loss_ratio * 100.0) as i32 / 5 * 5).clamp(0, 25)
    }
}
```

#### Message Lane: Voice

Voice traffic uses a new `MessageLane::Voice` lane, positioned between `Chat` and `Bulk`:

```rust
pub enum MessageLane {
    Orders = 0,
    Control = 1,
    Chat = 2,
    Voice = 3,    // NEW — voice frames
    Bulk = 4,     // was 3, renumbered
}
```

| Lane      | Priority | Weight | Buffer | Reliability | Rationale                                                     |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Orders`  | 0        | 1      | 4 KB   | Reliable    | Orders must arrive; missed = Idle (deadline is the cap)       |
| `Control` | 0        | 1      | 2 KB   | Unreliable  | Latest sync hash wins; stale hashes are useless               |
| `Chat`    | 1        | 1      | 8 KB   | Reliable    | Chat messages should arrive but can wait                      |
| `Voice`   | 1        | 2      | 16 KB  | Unreliable  | Real-time voice; dropped frames use Opus PLC (not retransmit) |
| `Bulk`    | 2        | 1      | 64 KB  | Unreliable  | Telemetry/observer data uses spare bandwidth                  |

**Voice and Chat share priority tier 1** with a 2:1 weight ratio — voice gets twice the bandwidth share because it's time-sensitive. Under bandwidth pressure, Orders and Control are served first (tier 0), then Voice and Chat split the remainder (tier 1, 67%/33%), then Bulk gets whatever is left (tier 2). This ensures voice never delays order delivery, but voice frames are prioritized over chat messages within the non-critical tier.

**Buffer limit:** 16 KB allows ~73ms of buffered voice at the default 32 kbps (~148 frames at 108 bytes each). If the buffer fills (severe congestion), the oldest voice frames are dropped — this is correct behavior for real-time audio (stale audio is worse than silence).

#### Voice Packet Format

```rust
/// Voice data packet. Travels on MessageLane::Voice.
/// NOT a PlayerOrder — voice never enters the sim.
/// Encoded in the lane's framing, not the order TLV format.
pub struct VoicePacket {
    /// Which player is speaking. Set by relay (not client) to prevent spoofing.
    pub speaker: PlayerId,
    /// Monotonically increasing sequence number for ordering + loss detection.
    pub sequence: u32,
    /// Opus frame count in this packet (typically 1, max 3 for 60ms bundling).
    pub frame_count: u8,
    /// Voice routing target. The relay uses this to determine forwarding.
    pub target: VoiceTarget,
    /// Flags: SPATIAL (positional audio hint), FEC (frame contains FEC data).
    pub flags: VoiceFlags,
    /// Opus-encoded audio payload. Size determined by bitrate and frame_count.
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
}

/// Who should hear this voice transmission.
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum VoiceTarget {
    /// All players and observers hear the transmission.
    All,
    /// Only same-team players.
    Team,
    /// Specific player (private voice — rare, but useful for coaching/tutoring).
    Player(PlayerId),
}

bitflags! {
    pub struct VoiceFlags: u8 {
        /// Positional audio hint — the listener should spatialize this
        /// voice based on the speaker's camera position or selected units.
        /// Opt-in via D033 QoL toggle. Disabled by default.
        const SPATIAL = 0x01;
        /// This packet contains Opus in-band FEC data for the previous frame.
        const FEC     = 0x02;
    }
}
```

**Speaker ID is relay-assigned.** The client sends voice data; the relay stamps `speaker` before forwarding. This prevents voice spoofing — a client cannot impersonate another player's voice. Same pattern as ioquake3's server-side VoIP relay (where `sv_client.c` stamps the client number on forwarded voice packets).

#### Relay Voice Forwarding

The relay server forwards voice packets with minimal processing:

```rust
/// Relay-side voice forwarding. Per-client, per-tick.
/// The relay does NOT decode Opus — it forwards opaque bytes.
/// This keeps relay CPU cost near zero for voice.
impl RelaySession {
    fn forward_voice(&mut self, from: PlayerId, packet: &VoicePacket) {
        // 1. Validate: is this player allowed to speak? (not muted, not observer in competitive)
        if self.is_muted(from) { return; }

        // 2. Rate limit: max voice_packets_per_second per player (default 50 = 1 per 20ms)
        if !self.voice_rate_limiter.check(from) { return; }

        // 3. Stamp speaker ID (overwrite whatever the client sent)
        let mut forwarded = packet.clone();
        forwarded.speaker = from;

        // 4. Route based on VoiceTarget
        match packet.target {
            VoiceTarget::All => {
                for client in &self.clients {
                    if client.id != from && !client.has_muted(from) {
                        client.send_voice(&forwarded);
                    }
                }
            }
            VoiceTarget::Team => {
                for client in &self.clients {
                    if client.id != from
                        && client.team == self.clients[from].team
                        && !client.has_muted(from)
                    {
                        client.send_voice(&forwarded);
                    }
                }
            }
            VoiceTarget::Player(target) => {
                if let Some(client) = self.clients.get(target) {
                    if !client.has_muted(from) {
                        client.send_voice(&forwarded);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Relay bandwidth cost:** The relay is a packet reflector for voice — it copies bytes without decoding. For an 8-player game where 2 players speak simultaneously at the default 32 kbps, the relay transmits: 2 speakers × 7 recipients × 5.4 KB/s = ~75.6 KB/s outbound. This is negligible for a server. The relay already handles order forwarding; voice adds proportionally small overhead.

#### Spatial Audio (Optional)

Inspired by ioquake3's `VOIP_SPATIAL` flag and Mumble's positional audio plugin:

When `VoiceFlags::SPATIAL` is set, the receiving client spatializes the voice based on the speaker's in-game position. The speaker's position is derived from their primary selection or camera center — NOT transmitted in the voice packet (that would leak tactical information). The receiver's client already knows all unit positions (lockstep sim), so it can compute relative direction and distance locally.

**Spatial audio is a D033 QoL toggle** (`voice.spatial_audio: bool`, default `false`). When enabled, teammates' voice is panned left/right based on where their units are on the map. This creates a natural "war room" effect — you hear your ally to your left when their base is left of yours.

**Why disabled by default:** Spatial voice is disorienting if unexpected. Players accustomed to centered voice chat need to opt in. Additionally, it only makes sense in team games with distinct player positions — 1v1 games get no benefit.

#### Browser (WASM) VoIP

Native desktop clients use raw Opus-over-UDP through the `UdpTransport` (D054). Browser clients cannot use raw UDP — they use WebRTC for voice transport.

**str0m** (github.com/algesten/str0m) is the recommended Rust WebRTC library:
- Pure Rust, Sans I/O (no internal threads — matches IC's architecture)
- Frame-level and RTP-level APIs
- Multiple crypto backends (aws-lc-rs, ring, OpenSSL, platform-native)
- Bandwidth estimation (BWE), NACK, Simulcast support
- `&mut self` pattern — no internal mutexes
- 515+ stars, 43+ contributors, 602 dependents

For browser builds, VoIP uses str0m's WebRTC data channels routed through the relay. The relay bridges WebRTC ↔ raw UDP voice packets, enabling cross-platform voice between native and browser clients. The Opus payload is identical — only the transport framing differs.

```rust
/// VoIP transport selection — the INITIAL transport chosen per platform.
/// This is a static selection at connection time (platform-dependent).
/// Runtime transport adaptation (e.g., UDP→TCP fallback) is handled by
/// VoiceTransportState (see § "Connection Recovery" below), which is a
/// separate state machine that manages degraded-mode transitions without
/// changing the VoiceTransport enum.
pub enum VoiceTransport {
    /// Raw Opus frames on MessageLane::Voice over UdpTransport.
    /// Desktop default. Lowest latency, lowest overhead.
    Native,
    /// Opus frames via WebRTC data channel (str0m).
    /// Browser builds. Higher overhead but compatible with browser APIs.
    WebRtc,
}
```

#### Muting and Moderation

Per-player mute is client-side AND relay-enforced:

| Action              | Scope       | Mechanism                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Player mutes**    | Client-side | Receiver ignores voice from muted player. Also sends mute hint to relay. |
| **Relay mute hint** | Server-side | Relay skips forwarding to the muting player — saves bandwidth.           |
| **Admin mute**      | Server-side | Relay drops all voice from the muted player. Cannot be overridden.       |
| **Self-mute**       | Client-side | PTT disabled, mic input stopped. "Muted" icon shown to other players.    |
| **Self-deafen**     | Client-side | All incoming voice silenced. "Deafened" icon shown.                      |

**Mute persistence:** Per-player mute decisions are stored in local SQLite (D034) keyed by the player's Ed25519 public key (D052). Muting "Bob" in one game persists across future games with the same player. The relay does not store mute relationships — mute is a client preference, communicated to the relay as a routing hint.

**Hotmic protection:** If PTT is held continuously for longer than `voice.max_ptt_duration` (default 120 seconds, configurable), transmission is automatically cut and the player sees a "PTT timeout — release and re-press to continue" notification. This prevents stuck-key scenarios where a player unknowingly broadcasts for an entire match (keyboard malfunction, key binding conflict, cat on keyboard). Discord implements similar detection; CS2 cuts after ~60 seconds continuous transmission. The timeout resets immediately on key release — there is no cooldown.

**Communication abuse penalties:** Repeated mute/report actions against a player across multiple games trigger **progressive communication restrictions** on that player's community profile (D052/D053). The community server (D052) tracks reports per player:

| Threshold            | Penalty                                                    | Duration       | Scope                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| 3 reports in 24h     | Warning displayed to player                                | Immediate      | Informational only   |
| 5 reports in 72h     | Voice-restricted: team-only voice, no all-chat voice       | 24 hours       | Per community server |
| 10 reports in 7 days | Voice-muted: cannot transmit voice                         | 72 hours       | Per community server |
| Repeated offenses    | Escalated to community moderators (D037) for manual review | Until resolved | Per community server |

Thresholds are configurable per community server — tournament communities may be stricter. Penalties are community-scoped (D052 federation), not global. A player comm-banned on one community can still speak on others. Text chat follows the same escalation path. False report abuse is itself a reportable offense.

#### Jitter Buffer

Voice packets arrive with variable delay (network jitter). Without a jitter buffer, packets arriving late cause audio stuttering and packets arriving out-of-order cause gaps. Every production VoIP system uses a jitter buffer — Mumble, Discord, TeamSpeak, and WebRTC all implement one. D059 requires an **adaptive jitter buffer** per-speaker in `ic-audio`.

**Design rationale:** A fixed jitter buffer (constant delay) wastes latency on good networks and is insufficient on bad networks. An adaptive buffer dynamically adjusts delay based on observed inter-arrival jitter — expanding when jitter increases (prevents drops) and shrinking when jitter decreases (minimizes latency). This is the universal approach in production VoIP systems (see `research/open-source-voip-analysis.md` § 6).

```rust
/// Adaptive jitter buffer for voice playback.
/// Smooths variable packet arrival times into consistent playback.
/// One instance per speaker, managed by ic-audio.
///
/// Design informed by Mumble's audio pipeline and WebRTC's NetEq.
/// Mumble uses a similar approach with its Resynchronizer for echo
/// cancellation timing — IC generalizes this to all voice playback.
pub struct JitterBuffer {
    /// Ring buffer of received voice frames, indexed by sequence number.
    /// None entries represent lost or not-yet-arrived packets.
    frames: VecDeque<Option<VoiceFrame>>,
    /// Current playback delay in 20ms frame units.
    /// E.g., delay=3 means 60ms of buffered audio before playback starts.
    delay: u32,
    /// Minimum delay (frames). Default: 1 (20ms).
    min_delay: u32,
    /// Maximum delay (frames). Default: 10 (200ms).
    /// Above 200ms, voice feels too delayed for real-time conversation.
    max_delay: u32,
    /// Exponentially weighted moving average of inter-arrival jitter.
    jitter_estimate: f32,   // f32 OK — this is I/O, not sim
    /// Timestamp of last received frame for jitter calculation.
    last_arrival: Instant,
    /// Statistics: total frames received, lost, late, buffer expansions/contractions.
    stats: JitterStats,
}

impl JitterBuffer {
    /// Called when a voice packet arrives from the network.
    pub fn push(&mut self, sequence: u32, opus_data: &[u8], now: Instant) {
        // Update jitter estimate using EWMA
        let arrival_delta = now - self.last_arrival;
        let expected_delta = Duration::from_millis(20); // one frame period
        let jitter = (arrival_delta.as_secs_f32() - expected_delta.as_secs_f32()).abs();
        // Smoothing factor 0.9 — reacts within ~10 packets to jitter changes
        self.jitter_estimate = 0.9 * self.jitter_estimate + 0.1 * jitter;
        self.last_arrival = now;
        
        // Insert frame at correct position based on sequence number.
        // Handles out-of-order delivery by placing in the correct slot.
        self.insert_frame(sequence, opus_data);
        
        // Adapt buffer depth based on current jitter estimate
        self.adapt_delay();
    }
    
    /// Called every 20ms by the audio render thread.
    /// Returns the next frame to play, or None if the frame is missing.
    /// On None, the caller invokes Opus PLC (decoder with null input)
    /// to generate concealment audio from the previous frame's spectral envelope.
    pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<VoiceFrame> {
        self.frames.pop_front().flatten()
    }
    
    fn adapt_delay(&mut self) {
        // Target: 2× jitter estimate + 1 frame covers ~95% of variance
        let target = ((2.0 * self.jitter_estimate * 50.0) as u32 + 1)
            .clamp(self.min_delay, self.max_delay);
        
        if target > self.delay {
            // Increase delay: expand buffer immediately (insert silence frame)
            self.delay += 1;
        } else if target + 2 < self.delay {
            // Decrease delay: only when significantly over-buffered
            // Hysteresis of 2 frames prevents oscillation on borderline networks
            self.delay -= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

**Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) integration:** When `pop()` returns `None` (missing frame due to packet loss), the Opus decoder is called with null input (`opus_decode(null, 0, ...)`) to generate PLC audio. Opus's built-in PLC extrapolates from the previous frame's spectral envelope, producing a smooth fade-out over 3-5 lost frames. At 5% packet loss, PLC is barely audible. At 15% loss, artifacts become noticeable — this is where the `VoiceBitrateAdapter` reduces bitrate and increases FEC allocation. Combined with dynamic `OPUS_SET_PACKET_LOSS_PERC` (see Adaptive Bitrate above), the encoder and decoder cooperate: the encoder allocates more bits to FEC when loss is high, and the decoder conceals any remaining gaps.

#### UDP Connectivity Checks and TCP Tunnel Fallback

Learned from Mumble's protocol (see `research/open-source-voip-analysis.md` § 7): some networks block or heavily throttle UDP (corporate firewalls, restrictive NATs, aggressive ISP rate limiting). D059 must not assume voice always uses UDP.

Mumble solves this with a graceful fallback: the client sends periodic UDP ping packets; if responses stop, voice is tunneled through the TCP control connection transparently. IC adopts this pattern:

```rust
/// Voice transport state machine. Manages UDP/TCP fallback for voice.
/// Runs on each client independently. The relay accepts voice from
/// either transport — it doesn't care how the bytes arrived.
pub enum VoiceTransportState {
    /// UDP voice active. UDP pings succeeding.
    /// Default state when connection is established.
    UdpActive,
    /// UDP pings failing. Testing connectivity.
    /// Voice is tunneled through TCP/WebSocket during this state.
    /// UDP pings continue in background to detect recovery.
    UdpProbing {
        last_ping: Instant,
        consecutive_failures: u8,  // switch to TcpTunnel after 5 failures
    },
    /// UDP confirmed unavailable. Voice fully tunneled through TCP.
    /// Higher latency (~20-50ms from TCP queuing) but maintains connectivity.
    /// UDP pings continue every 5 seconds to detect recovery.
    TcpTunnel,
    /// UDP restored after tunnel period. Transitioning back.
    /// Requires 3 consecutive successful UDP pings before switching.
    UdpRestoring { consecutive_successes: u8 },
}
```

**How TCP tunneling works:** Voice frames use the same `VoicePacket` binary format regardless of transport. When tunneled through TCP, voice packets are sent as a distinct message type on the existing control connection — the relay identifies the message type and forwards the voice payload normally. The relay doesn't care whether voice arrived via UDP or TCP; it stamps the speaker ID and forwards to recipients.

**UI indicator:** A small icon in the voice overlay shows the transport state — "Direct" (UDP, normal) or "Tunneled" (TCP, yellow warning icon). Tunneled voice has ~20-50ms additional latency from TCP head-of-line blocking but is preferable to no voice at all.

**Implementation phasing note (from Mumble documentation):** "When implementing the protocol it is easier to ignore the UDP transfer layer at first and just tunnel the UDP data through the TCP tunnel. The TCP layer must be implemented for authentication in any case." This matches IC's phased approach — TCP-tunneled voice can ship in Phase 3 (alongside text chat), with UDP voice optimization in Phase 5.

#### Audio Preprocessing Pipeline

The audio capture-to-encode pipeline in `ic-audio`. Order matters — this sequence is the standard across Mumble, Discord, WebRTC, and every production VoIP system (see `research/open-source-voip-analysis.md` § 8):

```
Platform Capture (cpal) → Resample to 48kHz (rubato) →
  Echo Cancellation (optional, speaker users only) →
    Noise Suppression (nnnoiseless / RNNoise) →
      Voice Activity Detection (for VAD mode) →
        Opus Encode (audiopus, VOIP mode, FEC, DTX) →
          VoicePacket → MessageLane::Voice
```

**Recommended Rust crates for the pipeline:**

| Noise suppression | `nnnoiseless`                                  | Pure Rust port of Mozilla's RNNoise. ML-based (GRU neural network). Dramatically better than DSP-based Speex preprocessing for non-stationary noise (keyboard clicks, fans, traffic). ~0.3% CPU cost per core — negligible.           |
| Opus codec        | `audiopus`                                     | Safe Rust wrapper around libopus. Required. Handles encode/decode/PLC.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Echo cancellation | Speex AEC via `speexdsp-rs`, or browser-native | Full AEC only matters for speaker/laptop users (not headset). Mumble's `Resynchronizer` shows this requires a ~20ms mic delay queue to ensure speaker data reaches the canceller first. Browser builds can use WebRTC's built-in AEC. |

**Why RNNoise (`nnnoiseless`) over Speex preprocessing:** Mumble supports both. RNNoise is categorically superior — it uses a recurrent neural network trained on 80+ hours of noise samples, whereas Speex uses traditional FFT-based spectral subtraction. RNNoise handles non-stationary noise (typing, mouse clicks — common in RTS gameplay) far better than Speex. The `nnnoiseless` crate is pure Rust (no C dependency), adding ~0.3% CPU per core versus Speex's ~0.1%. This is negligible on any hardware that can run IC. Noise suppression is a D033 QoL toggle (`voice.noise_suppression: bool`, default `true`).

**Playback pipeline (receive side):**

```
MessageLane::Voice → VoicePacket → JitterBuffer →
  Opus Decode (or PLC on missing frame) →
    Per-speaker gain (user volume setting) →
      Voice Effects Chain (if enabled — see below) →
        Spatial panning (if VoiceFlags::SPATIAL) →
          Mix with game audio → Platform Output (cpal/Bevy audio)
```

#### Voice Effects & Enhancement

Voice effects apply DSP processing to incoming voice on the **receiver side** — after Opus decode, before spatial panning and mixing. This is a deliberate architectural choice:

- **Receiver controls their experience.** Alice hears radio-filtered voice; Bob hears clean audio. Neither imposes on the other.
- **Clean audio preserved.** The Opus-encoded stream in replays (voice-in-replay, D059 § 7) is unprocessed. Effects can be re-applied during replay playback with different presets — a caster might use clean voice while a viewer uses radio flavor.
- **No codec penalty.** Applying effects before Opus encoding wastes bits encoding the effect rather than the voice. Receiver-side effects are "free" from a compression perspective.
- **Per-speaker effects.** A player can assign different effects to different teammates (e.g., radio filter on ally A, clean for ally B) via per-speaker settings.

##### DSP Chain Architecture

Each voice effect preset is a composable chain of lightweight DSP stages:

```rust
/// A single DSP processing stage. Implementations are stateful
/// (filters maintain internal buffers) but cheap — a biquad filter
/// processes 960 samples (20ms at 48kHz) in <5 microseconds.
pub trait VoiceEffectStage: Send + 'static {
    /// Process samples in-place. Called on the audio thread.
    /// `sample_rate` is always 48000 (Opus output).
    fn process(&mut self, samples: &mut [f32], sample_rate: u32);

    /// Reset internal state. Called when a speaker stops and restarts
    /// (avoids filter ringing from stale state across transmissions).
    fn reset(&mut self);

    /// Human-readable name for diagnostics.
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
}

/// A complete voice effect preset — an ordered chain of DSP stages
/// plus optional transmission envelope effects (squelch tones).
pub struct VoiceEffectChain {
    pub stages: Vec<Box<dyn VoiceEffectStage>>,
    pub squelch: Option<SquelchConfig>,
    pub metadata: EffectMetadata,
}

/// Squelch tones — short audio cues on transmission start/end.
/// Classic military radio has a distinctive "roger beep."
pub struct SquelchConfig {
    pub start_tone_hz: u32,       // e.g., 1200 Hz
    pub end_tone_hz: u32,         // e.g., 800 Hz
    pub duration_ms: u32,         // e.g., 60ms
    pub volume: f32,              // 0.0-1.0, relative to voice
}

pub struct EffectMetadata {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub version: String,         // semver
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
}
```

**Built-in DSP stages** (implemented in `ic-audio`, no external crate dependencies beyond `std` math):

| Stage             | Parameters                                              | Use                                                                      | CPU Cost (960 samples) |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `BiquadFilter`    | `mode` (LP/HP/BP/notch/shelf), `freq_hz`, `q`, `gain`   | Band-pass for radio; high-shelf for presence; low-cut for clarity        | ~3 μs                  |
| `Compressor`      | `threshold_db`, `ratio`, `attack_ms`, `release_ms`      | Even out loud/quiet speakers; radio dynamic range control                | ~5 μs                  |
| `SoftClipDistort` | `drive` (0.0-1.0), `mode` (soft_clip / tube / foldback) | Subtle harmonic warmth for vintage radio; tube saturation                | ~2 μs                  |
| `NoiseGate`       | `threshold_db`, `attack_ms`, `release_ms`, `hold_ms`    | Radio squelch — silence below threshold; clean up mic bleed              | ~3 μs                  |
| `NoiseLayer`      | `type` (static / crackle / hiss), `level_db`, `seed`    | Atmospheric static for radio presets; deterministic seed for consistency | ~4 μs                  |
| `SimpleReverb`    | `decay_ms`, `mix` (0.0-1.0), `pre_delay_ms`             | Room/bunker ambiance; short decay for command post feel                  | ~8 μs                  |
| `DeEsser`         | `frequency_hz`, `threshold_db`, `ratio`                 | Sibilance reduction; tames harsh microphones                             | ~5 μs                  |
| `GainStage`       | `gain_db`                                               | Level adjustment between stages; makeup gain after compression           | ~1 μs                  |
| `FrequencyShift`  | `shift_hz`, `mix` (0.0-1.0)                             | Subtle pitch shift for scrambled/encrypted effect                        | ~6 μs                  |

**CPU budget:** A 6-stage chain (typical for radio presets) costs ~25 μs per speaker per 20ms frame. With 8 simultaneous speakers, that's 200 μs — well under 5% of the audio thread's budget. Even aggressive 10-stage custom chains remain negligible.

**Why no external DSP crate:** Audio DSP filter implementations are straightforward (a biquad is ~10 lines of Rust). External crates like `fundsp` or `dasp` are excellent for complex synthesis but add dependency weight for operations that IC needs in their simplest form. The built-in stages above total ~500 lines of Rust. If future effects need convolution reverb or FFT-based processing, `fundsp` becomes a justified dependency — but the Phase 3 built-in presets don't require it.

##### Built-in Presets

Six presets ship with IC, spanning practical enhancement to thematic immersion. All are defined in YAML — the same format modders use for custom presets.

**1. Clean Enhanced** — *Practical voice clarity without character effects.*

Noise gate removes mic bleed, gentle compression evens volume differences between speakers, de-esser tames harsh sibilance, and a subtle high-shelf adds presence. Recommended for competitive play where voice clarity matters more than atmosphere.

```yaml
name: "Clean Enhanced"
description: "Improved voice clarity — compression, de-essing, noise gate"
tags: ["clean", "competitive", "clarity"]
chain:
  - type: noise_gate
    threshold_db: -42
    attack_ms: 1
    release_ms: 80
    hold_ms: 50
  - type: compressor
    threshold_db: -22
    ratio: 3.0
    attack_ms: 8
    release_ms: 60
  - type: de_esser
    frequency_hz: 6500
    threshold_db: -15
    ratio: 4.0
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: high_shelf
    freq_hz: 3000
    q: 0.7
    gain_db: 2.0
```

**2. Military Radio** — *NATO-standard HF radio. The signature IC effect.*

Tight band-pass (300 Hz–3.4 kHz) matches real HF radio bandwidth. Compression squashes dynamic range like AGC circuitry. Subtle soft-clip distortion adds harmonic warmth. Noise gate creates a squelch effect. A faint static layer completes the illusion. Squelch tones mark transmission start/end — the distinctive "roger beep" of military comms.

```yaml
name: "Military Radio"
description: "NATO HF radio — tight bandwidth, squelch, static crackle"
tags: ["radio", "military", "immersive", "cold-war"]
chain:
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: high_pass
    freq_hz: 300
    q: 0.7
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: low_pass
    freq_hz: 3400
    q: 0.7
  - type: compressor
    threshold_db: -18
    ratio: 6.0
    attack_ms: 3
    release_ms: 40
  - type: soft_clip_distortion
    drive: 0.12
    mode: tube
  - type: noise_gate
    threshold_db: -38
    attack_ms: 1
    release_ms: 100
    hold_ms: 30
  - type: noise_layer
    type: static_crackle
    level_db: -32
squelch:
  start_tone_hz: 1200
  end_tone_hz: 800
  duration_ms: 60
  volume: 0.25
```

**3. Field Radio** — *Forward observer radio with environmental interference.*

Wider band-pass than Military Radio (less "studio," more "field"). Heavier static and occasional signal drift (subtle frequency wobble). No squelch tones — field conditions are rougher. The effect intensifies when `ConnectionQuality.quality_tier` drops (more static at lower quality) — adaptive degradation as a feature, not a bug.

```yaml
name: "Field Radio"
description: "Frontline field radio — static interference, signal drift"
tags: ["radio", "military", "atmospheric", "cold-war"]
chain:
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: high_pass
    freq_hz: 250
    q: 0.5
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: low_pass
    freq_hz: 3800
    q: 0.5
  - type: compressor
    threshold_db: -20
    ratio: 4.0
    attack_ms: 5
    release_ms: 50
  - type: soft_clip_distortion
    drive: 0.20
    mode: soft_clip
  - type: noise_layer
    type: static_crackle
    level_db: -26
  - type: frequency_shift
    shift_hz: 0.3
    mix: 0.05
```

**4. Command Post** — *Bunker-filtered comms with short reverb.*

Short reverb (~180ms decay) creates the acoustic signature of a concrete command bunker. Slight band-pass and compression. No static — the command post has clean equipment. This is the "mission briefing room" voice.

```yaml
name: "Command Post"
description: "Concrete bunker comms — short reverb, clean equipment"
tags: ["bunker", "military", "reverb", "cold-war"]
chain:
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: high_pass
    freq_hz: 200
    q: 0.7
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: low_pass
    freq_hz: 5000
    q: 0.7
  - type: compressor
    threshold_db: -20
    ratio: 3.5
    attack_ms: 5
    release_ms: 50
  - type: simple_reverb
    decay_ms: 180
    mix: 0.20
    pre_delay_ms: 8
```

**5. SIGINT Intercept** — *Encrypted comms being decoded. For fun.*

Frequency shifting, periodic glitch artifacts, and heavy processing create the effect of intercepted encrypted communications being partially decoded. Not practical for serious play — this is the "I'm playing a spy" preset.

```yaml
name: "SIGINT Intercept"
description: "Intercepted encrypted communications — partial decode artifacts"
tags: ["scrambled", "spy", "fun", "cold-war"]
chain:
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: band_pass
    freq_hz: 1500
    q: 2.0
  - type: frequency_shift
    shift_hz: 3.0
    mix: 0.15
  - type: soft_clip_distortion
    drive: 0.30
    mode: foldback
  - type: compressor
    threshold_db: -15
    ratio: 8.0
    attack_ms: 1
    release_ms: 30
  - type: noise_layer
    type: hiss
    level_db: -28
```

**6. Vintage Valve** — *1940s vacuum tube radio warmth.*

Warm tube saturation, narrower bandwidth than HF radio, gentle compression. Evokes WW2-era communications equipment. Pairs well with Tiberian Dawn's earlier-era aesthetic.

```yaml
name: "Vintage Valve"
description: "Vacuum tube radio — warm saturation, WW2-era bandwidth"
tags: ["radio", "vintage", "warm", "retro"]
chain:
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: high_pass
    freq_hz: 350
    q: 0.5
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: low_pass
    freq_hz: 2800
    q: 0.5
  - type: soft_clip_distortion
    drive: 0.25
    mode: tube
  - type: compressor
    threshold_db: -22
    ratio: 3.0
    attack_ms: 10
    release_ms: 80
  - type: gain_stage
    gain_db: -2.0
  - type: noise_layer
    type: hiss
    level_db: -30
squelch:
  start_tone_hz: 1000
  end_tone_hz: 600
  duration_ms: 80
  volume: 0.20
```

##### Enhanced Voice Isolation (Background Voice Removal)

The user's request for "getting rid of background voices" is addressed at two levels:

1. **Sender-side (existing):** `nnnoiseless` (RNNoise) already handles this on the capture side. RNNoise's GRU neural network is trained specifically to isolate a primary speaker from background noise — including other voices. It performs well against TV audio, family conversations, and roommate speech because these register as non-stationary noise at lower amplitude than the primary mic input. This is already enabled by default (`voice.noise_suppression: true`).

2. **Receiver-side (new, optional):** An enhanced isolation mode applies a second `nnnoiseless` pass on the decoded audio. This catches background voices that survived Opus compression (Opus preserves all audio above the encoding threshold — including faint background voices that RNNoise on the sender side left in). The double-pass is more aggressive but risks removing valid speaker audio in edge cases (e.g., two people talking simultaneously into one mic). Exposed as `voice.enhanced_isolation: bool` (D033 toggle, default `false`).

**Why receiver-side isolation is optional:** Double-pass noise suppression can create audible artifacts — "underwater" voice quality when the second pass is too aggressive. Most users will find sender-side RNNoise sufficient. Enhanced isolation is for environments where background voices are a persistent problem (shared rooms, open offices) and the speaker cannot control their environment.

##### Workshop Voice Effect Presets

Voice effect presets are a Workshop resource type (D030), published and shared like any other mod resource:

**Resource type:** `voice_effect` (Workshop category: "Voice Effects")
**File format:** YAML with `.icvfx.yaml` extension (standard YAML — `serde_yaml` deserialization)
**Version:** Semver, following Workshop resource conventions (D030)

**Workshop preset structure:**

```yaml
# File: radio_spetsnaz.icvfx.yaml
# Workshop metadata block (same as all Workshop resources)
workshop:
  name: "Spetsnaz Radio"
  description: "Soviet military radio — heavy static, narrow bandwidth, authentic squelch"
  author: "comrade_modder"
  version: "1.2.0"
  license: "CC-BY-4.0"
  tags: ["radio", "soviet", "military", "cold-war", "immersive"]
  # Optional LLM metadata (D016 narrative DNA)
  llm:
    tone: "Soviet military communications — terse, formal"
    era: "Cold War, 1980s"

# DSP chain — same format as built-in presets
chain:
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: high_pass
    freq_hz: 400
    q: 0.8
  - type: biquad_filter
    mode: low_pass
    freq_hz: 2800
    q: 0.8
  - type: compressor
    threshold_db: -16
    ratio: 8.0
    attack_ms: 2
    release_ms: 30
  - type: soft_clip_distortion
    drive: 0.18
    mode: tube
  - type: noise_layer
    type: static_crackle
    level_db: -24
squelch:
  start_tone_hz: 1400
  end_tone_hz: 900
  duration_ms: 50
  volume: 0.30
```

**Preview before subscribing:** The Workshop browser includes an "audition" feature — a 5-second sample voice clip (bundled with IC) is processed through the effect in real-time and played back. Players hear exactly what the effect sounds like before downloading. This uses the same DSP chain instantiation as live voice — no separate preview system.

**Validation:** Workshop voice effects are pure data (YAML DSP parameters). The DSP stages are built-in engine code — presets cannot execute arbitrary code. Parameter values are clamped to safe ranges (e.g., `drive` 0.0-1.0, `freq_hz` 20-20000, `gain_db` -40 to +20). This is inherently sandboxed — a malicious preset can at worst produce unpleasant audio, never crash the engine or access the filesystem. If a `chain` stage references an unknown `type`, it is skipped with a warning log.

**CLI tooling:** The `ic` CLI supports effect preset development:

```bash
ic audio effect preview radio_spetsnaz.icvfx.yaml      # Preview with sample clip
ic audio effect validate radio_spetsnaz.icvfx.yaml      # Check YAML structure + param ranges
ic audio effect chain-info radio_spetsnaz.icvfx.yaml    # Print stage count, CPU estimate
ic workshop publish --type voice-effect radio_spetsnaz.icvfx.yaml
```

##### Voice Effect Settings Integration

Updated `VoiceSettings` resource (additions in bold comments):

```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
pub struct VoiceSettings {
    pub noise_suppression: bool,       // D033 toggle, default true
    pub enhanced_isolation: bool,      // D033 toggle, default false — receiver-side double-pass
    pub spatial_audio: bool,           // D033 toggle, default false
    pub vad_mode: bool,                // false = PTT, true = VAD
    pub ptt_key: KeyCode,
    pub max_ptt_duration_secs: u32,    // hotmic protection, default 120
    pub effect_preset: Option<String>, // D033 setting — preset name or None for bypass
    pub effect_enabled: bool,          // D033 toggle, default false — master effect switch
    pub per_speaker_effects: HashMap<PlayerId, String>, // per-speaker override presets
}
```

**D033 QoL toggle pattern:** Voice effects follow the same toggle pattern as spatial audio and noise suppression. The `effect_preset` name is a D033 setting (selectable in voice settings UI). Experience profiles (D033) can bundle a voice effect preset with other preferences — e.g., an "Immersive" profile might enable spatial audio + Military Radio effect + smart danger alerts.

**Audio thread sync:** When `VoiceSettings` changes (user selects a new preset in the UI), the ECS → audio thread channel sends a `VoiceCommand::SetEffectPreset(chain)` message. The audio thread instantiates the new `VoiceEffectChain` and applies it starting from the next decoded frame. No glitch — the old chain's state is discarded and the new chain processes from a clean `reset()` state.

##### Competitive Considerations

Voice effects are **cosmetic audio processing** with no competitive implications:

- **Receiver-side only** — what you hear is your choice, not imposed on others. No player gains information advantage from voice effects.
- **No simulation interaction** — effects run entirely in `ic-audio` on the playback thread. Zero contact with `ic-sim`.
- **Tournament mode (D058):** Tournament organizers can restrict voice effects via lobby settings (`voice_effects_allowed: bool`). Broadcast streams may want clean voice for professional production. The restriction is per-lobby, not global — community tournaments set their own rules.
- **Replay casters:** When casting replays with voice-in-replay, casters apply their own effect preset (or none). This means the same replay can sound like a military briefing or a clean podcast depending on the caster's preference.

#### ECS Integration and Audio Thread Architecture

Voice state management uses Bevy ECS. The real-time audio pipeline runs on a dedicated thread. This follows the same pattern as Bevy's own audio system — ECS components are the *control surface*; the audio thread is the *engine*.

**ECS components and resources** (in `ic-audio` and `ic-net` systems, regular `Update` schedule — NOT in `ic-sim`'s `FixedUpdate`):

**Crate boundary note:** `ic-audio` (voice processing, jitter buffer, Opus encode/decode) and `ic-net` (VoicePacket send/receive on `MessageLane::Voice`) do not depend on each other directly. The bridge is `ic-game`, which depends on both and wires them together at app startup: `ic-net` systems write incoming `VoicePacket` data to a crossbeam channel; `ic-audio` systems read from that channel to feed the jitter buffer. Outgoing voice follows the reverse path. This preserves crate independence while enabling data flow — the same integration pattern `ic-game` uses to wire `ic-sim` and `ic-net` via `ic-protocol`.

```rust
/// Attached to player entities. Updated by the voice network system
/// when VoicePackets arrive (or VoiceActivity orders are processed).
/// Queried by ic-ui to render speaker icons.
#[derive(Component)]
pub struct VoiceActivity {
    pub speaking: bool,
    pub last_transmission: Instant,
}

/// Per-player mute/deafen state. Written by UI and /mute commands.
/// Read by the voice network system to filter forwarding hints.
#[derive(Component)]

    pub self_mute: bool,
    pub self_deafen: bool,
    pub muted_players: HashSet<PlayerId>,
}

/// Per-player incoming voice volume (0.0–2.0). Written by UI slider.

#[derive(Component)]
pub struct VoiceVolume(pub f32);

/// Queried by ic-ui to render connection quality indicators.
#[derive(Component)]

    pub round_trip_ms: f32,
    pub buffer_depth_frames: u32,
    pub estimated_latency_ms: f32,
}

/// Global voice settings. Synced to audio thread on change.
#[derive(Resource)]
pub struct VoiceSettings {
    pub noise_suppression: bool,     // D033 toggle, default true
    pub enhanced_isolation: bool,    // D033 toggle, default false
    pub spatial_audio: bool,         // D033 toggle, default false
    pub vad_mode: bool,              // false = PTT, true = VAD
    pub ptt_key: KeyCode,
    pub max_ptt_duration_secs: u32,  // hotmic protection, default 120
    pub effect_preset: Option<String>, // D033 setting, None = bypass
    pub effect_enabled: bool,        // D033 toggle, default false
}
```

```

**Why the audio pipeline cannot be an ECS system:** ECS systems run on Bevy's task pool at frame rate (16ms at 60fps, 33ms at 30fps). Audio capture/playback runs on OS audio threads with ~5ms deadlines via `cpal` callbacks. A jitter buffer that pops every 20ms cannot be driven by a system running at frame rate — the timing mismatch causes audible artifacts. The audio thread runs independently and communicates with ECS via channels: the ECS side sends commands ("PTT pressed", "mute player X", "change bitrate") and receives events ("speaker X started", "diagnostics update", "encoded packet ready").

**What lives where:**

| Concern                                   | ECS? | Rationale                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Voice state (speaking, mute, volume)      | Yes  | Components on player entities, queried by UI systems      |
| Voice settings (PTT key, noise suppress)  | Yes  | Bevy resource, synced to audio thread via channel         |
| Voice effect preset selection             | Yes  | Part of VoiceSettings; chain instantiated on audio thread |
| Network send/receive (VoicePacket ↔ lane) | Yes  | ECS system bridges network layer and audio thread         |
| Voice UI (speaker icons, PTT indicator)   | Yes  | Standard Bevy UI systems querying voice components        |
| Audio capture + encode pipeline           | No   | Dedicated audio thread, cpal callback timing              |
| Jitter buffer + decode/PLC                | No   | Dedicated audio thread, 20ms frame cadence                |
| Audio output + mixing                     | No   | Bevy audio backend thread (existing)                      |

#### UI Indicators

Voice activity is shown in the game UI:

- **In-game overlay:** Small speaker icon next to the player's name/color indicator when they are transmitting. Follows the same placement as SC2's voice indicators (top-right player list).
- **Lobby:** Speaker icon pulses when a player is speaking. Volume slider per player.
- **Chat log:** `[VOICE] Alice is speaking` / `[VOICE] Alice stopped` timestamps in the chat log (optional, toggle via D033 QoL).
- **PTT indicator:** Small microphone icon in the bottom-right corner when PTT key is held. Red slash through it when self-muted.
- **Connection quality:** Per-speaker signal bars (1-4 bars) derived from `VoiceDiagnostics` — jitter, loss, and latency combined into a single quality score. Visible in the player list overlay next to the speaker icon. A player with consistently poor voice quality sees a tooltip: "Poor voice connection — high packet loss" to distinguish voice issues from game network issues. Transport state ("Direct" vs "Tunneled") shown as a small icon when TCP fallback is active.
- **Hotmic warning:** If PTT exceeds 90 seconds (75% of the 120s auto-cut threshold), the PTT indicator turns yellow with a countdown. At 120s, it cuts and shows a brief "PTT timeout" notification.
- **Voice diagnostics panel:** `/voice diag` command opens a detailed overlay (developer/power-user tool) showing per-speaker jitter histogram, packet loss graph, buffer depth, estimated mouth-to-ear latency, and encode/decode CPU time. This is the equivalent of Discord's "Voice & Video Debug" panel.
- **Voice effect indicator:** When a voice effect preset is active, a small filter icon appears next to the microphone indicator. Hovering shows the active preset name (e.g., "Military Radio"). The icon uses the preset's primary tag color (radio presets = olive drab, clean presets = blue, fun presets = purple).

#### Competitive Voice Rules

Voice behavior in competitive contexts requires explicit rules that D058's tournament/ranked modes enforce:

**Voice during pause:** Voice transmission continues during game pauses and tactical timeouts. Voice is I/O, not simulation — pausing the sim does not pause communication. This matches CS2 (voice continues during tactical timeout) and SC2 (voice unaffected by pause). Team coordination during pauses is a legitimate strategic activity.

**Eliminated player voice routing:** When a player is eliminated (all units/structures destroyed), their voice routing depends on the game mode:

| Mode              | Eliminated player can...                                                                  | Rationale                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casual / unranked | Remain on team voice                                                                      | Social experience; D021 eliminated-player roles (advisor, reinforcement controller) require voice                     |
| Ranked 1v1        | N/A (game ends on elimination)                                                            | No team to talk to                                                                                                    |
| Ranked team       | Remain on team voice for 60 seconds, then observer-only                                   | Brief window for handoff callouts, then prevents persistent backseat gaming. Configurable via tournament rules (D058) |
| Tournament        | Configurable by organizer: permanent team voice, timed cutoff, or immediate observer-only | Tournament organizers decide the rule for their event                                                                 |

**Ranked voice channel restrictions:** In ranked matchmaking (D055), `VoiceTarget::All` (all-chat voice) is **disabled**. Players can only use `VoiceTarget::Team`. All-chat text remains available (for gg/glhf). This matches CS2 and Valorant's competitive modes, which restrict voice to team-only. Rationale: cross-team voice is a toxicity vector and provides no competitive value. Tournament mode (D058) can re-enable all-voice if the organizer chooses (e.g., for show matches).

**Coach slot:** Community servers (D052) can designate a **coach slot** per team — a non-playing participant who has team voice access but cannot issue orders. The coach sees the team's shared vision (not full-map observer view). Coach voice routing uses `VoiceTarget::Team` but the coach's `PlayerId` is flagged as `PlayerRole::Coach` in the lobby. Coaches are subject to the same mute/report system as players. For ranked, coach slots are disabled (pure player skill measurement). For tournaments, organizer configures per-event. This follows CS2's coach system (voice during freezetime/timeouts, restricted during live rounds) but adapted for RTS where there are no freezetime rounds — the coach can speak at all times.

### 3. Beacons and Tactical Pings

The non-verbal coordination layer. Research shows this is often more effective than voice for spatial RTS communication — Respawn Entertainment play-tested Apex Legends for a month with no voice chat and found their ping system "rendered voice chat with strangers largely unnecessary" (Polygon review). EA opened the underlying patent (US 11097189, "Contextually Aware Communications Systems") for free use in August 2021.

#### OpenRA Beacon Compatibility (D024)

OpenRA's Lua API includes `Beacon` (map beacon management) and `Radar` (radar ping control) globals. IC must support these for mission script compatibility:

- `Beacon.New(owner, pos, duration, palette, isPlayerPalette)` — create a map beacon
- `Radar.Ping(player, pos, color, duration)` — flash a radar ping on the minimap

IC's beacon system is a superset — OpenRA's beacons are simple map markers with duration. IC adds contextual types, entity targeting, and the ping wheel (see below). OpenRA beacon/radar Lua calls map to `PingType::Generic` with appropriate visual parameters.

#### Ping Type System

```rust
/// Contextual ping types. Each has a distinct visual, audio cue, and
/// minimap representation. The set is fixed at the engine level but
/// game modules can register additional types via YAML.
///
/// Inspired by Apex Legends' contextual ping system, adapted for RTS:
/// Apex pings communicate "what is here" for a shared 3D space.
/// RTS pings communicate "what should we do about this location" for
/// a top-down strategic view. The emphasis shifts from identification
/// to intent.
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum PingType {
    /// General attention ping. "Look here."
    /// Default when no contextual modifier applies.
    Generic,
    /// Attack order suggestion. "Attack here / attack this unit."
    /// Shows crosshair icon. Red minimap flash.
    Attack,
    /// Defend order suggestion. "Defend this location."
    /// Shows shield icon. Blue minimap flash.
    Defend,
    /// Warning / danger alert. "Enemies here" or "be careful."
    /// Shows exclamation icon. Yellow minimap flash. Pulsing audio cue.
    Danger,
    /// Rally point. "Move units here" / "gather here."
    /// Shows flag icon. Green minimap flash.
    Rally,
    /// Request assistance. "I need help here."
    /// Shows SOS icon. Orange minimap flash with urgency pulse.
    Assist,
    /// Enemy spotted — marks a position where enemy units were seen.
    /// Auto-fades after the fog of war re-covers the area.
    /// Shows eye icon. Red blinking on minimap.
    EnemySpotted,
    /// Economic marker. "Expand here" / "ore field here."
    /// Shows resource icon. Green on minimap.
    Economy,
}
```

#### Contextual Ping (Apex Legends Adaptation)

The ping type auto-selects based on what's under the cursor when the ping key is pressed:

| Cursor Target                      | Auto-Selected Ping | Visual                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Empty terrain (own territory)      | `Rally`            | Flag marker at position            |
| Empty terrain (enemy territory)    | `Attack`           | Crosshair marker at position       |
| Empty terrain (neutral/unexplored) | `Generic`          | Diamond marker at position         |
| Visible enemy unit                 | `EnemySpotted`     | Eye icon tracking the unit briefly |
| Own damaged building               | `Assist`           | SOS icon on building               |
| Ore field / resource               | `Economy`          | Resource icon at position          |
| Fog-of-war edge                    | `Danger`           | Exclamation at fog boundary        |

**Override via ping wheel:** Holding the ping key (default: `G`) opens a radial menu (ping wheel) showing all 8 ping types. Flick the mouse in the desired direction to select. Release to place. Quick-tap (no hold) uses the contextual default. This two-tier interaction (quick contextual + deliberate selection) follows Apex Legends' proven UX pattern.

#### Ping Wheel UI

```
              Danger
         ╱            ╲
    Defend              Attack
       │    [cursor]     │
    Assist              Rally
         ╲            ╱
         Economy    EnemySpotted
              Generic
```

The ping wheel is a radial menu rendered by `ic-ui`. Each segment shows the ping type icon and name. The currently highlighted segment follows the mouse direction from center. Release places the selected ping type. Escape cancels.

**Controller support (Steam Deck / future console):** Ping wheel opens on right stick click, direction selected via stick. Quick-ping on D-pad press.

#### Ping Properties

```rust
/// A placed ping marker. Managed by ic-ui (rendering) and forwarded
/// to the sim via PlayerOrder::TacticalPing for replay recording.
pub struct PingMarker {
    pub id: PingId,
    pub owner: PlayerId,
    pub ping_type: PingType,
    pub pos: WorldPos,
    /// If the ping was placed on a specific entity, track it.
    /// The marker follows the entity until it dies or the ping expires.
    pub tracked_entity: Option<UnitTag>,
    /// Ping lifetime. Default 8 seconds. Danger pings pulse.
    pub duration: Duration,
    /// Audio cue played on placement. Each PingType has a distinct sound.
    pub audio_cue: PingAudioCue,
    /// Tick when placed (for expiration).
    pub placed_at: u64,
}
```

**Ping rate limiting:** Max 3 pings per 5 seconds per player (configurable). Exceeding the limit suppresses pings with a cooldown indicator. This prevents ping spam, which is a known toxicity vector in games with ping systems (LoL's "missing" ping spam problem).

**Ping persistence:** Pings are ephemeral — they expire after `duration` (default 8 seconds). They do NOT persist in save games. They DO appear in replays (via `PlayerOrder::TacticalPing` in the order stream).

**Audio feedback:** Each ping type has a distinct short audio cue (< 300ms). Incoming pings from teammates play the cue with a minimap flash. Audio volume follows the `voice.ping_volume` cvar (D058). Repeated rapid pings from the same player have diminishing audio (third ping in 5 seconds is silent) to reduce annoyance.

### 4. Novel Coordination Mechanics

Beyond standard chat/voice/pings, IC introduces coordination tools not found in other RTS games:

#### 4a. Chat Wheel (Dota 2 / Rocket League Pattern)

A radial menu of pre-defined phrases that are:
- **Instantly sent** — no typing, one keypress + flick
- **Auto-translated** — each phrase has a `phrase_id` that maps to the recipient's locale, enabling communication across language barriers
- **Replayable** — sent as `PlayerOrder::ChatWheelPhrase` in the order stream

```yaml
# chat_wheel_phrases.yaml — game module provides these
chat_wheel:
  phrases:
    - id: 1
      category: tactical
      label:
        en: "Attack now!"
        de: "Jetzt angreifen!"
        ru: "Атакуем!"
        zh: "现在进攻!"
      audio_cue: "eva_attack"  # optional EVA voice line

    - id: 2
      category: tactical
      label:
        en: "Fall back!"
        de: "Rückzug!"
        ru: "Отступаем!"
        zh: "撤退!"
      audio_cue: "eva_retreat"

    - id: 3
      category: tactical
      label:
        en: "Defend the base!"
        de: "Basis verteidigen!"
        ru: "Защищайте базу!"
        zh: "防守基地!"

    - id: 4
      category: economy
      label:
        en: "Need more ore"
        de: "Brauche mehr Erz"
        ru: "Нужна руда"
        zh: "需要更多矿石"

    - id: 5
      category: social
      label:
        en: "Good game!"
        de: "Gutes Spiel!"
        ru: "Хорошая игра!"
        zh: "打得好！"
      audio_cue: null

    - id: 6
      category: social
      label:
        en: "Well played"
        de: "Gut gespielt"
        ru: "Хорошо сыграно"
        zh: "打得漂亮"

    # ... 20-30 phrases per game module, community can add more via mods
```

**Chat wheel key:** Default `V`. Hold to open, flick to select, release to send. The phrase appears in team chat (or all chat, depending on category — social phrases go to all). The phrase displays in the recipient's language, but the chat log also shows `[wheel]` tag so observers know it's a pre-defined phrase.

**Why this matters for RTS:** International matchmaking means players frequently cannot communicate by text. The chat wheel solves this with zero typing — the same phrase ID maps to every supported language. Dota 2 proved this works at scale across a global player base. For IC's Cold War setting, phrases use military communication style: "Affirmative," "Negative," "Enemy contact," "Position compromised."

**Mod-extensible:** Game modules (RA1, TD, community mods) provide their own phrase sets via YAML. The engine provides the wheel UI and `ChatWheelPhrase` order — the phrases are data, not code.

#### 4b. Minimap Drawing

Players can draw directly on the minimap to communicate tactical plans:

- **Activation:** Hold `Alt` + click-drag on minimap (or `/draw` command via D058)
- **Visual:** Freeform line drawn in the player's team color. Visible to teammates only.
- **Duration:** Drawings fade after 8 seconds (same as pings).
- **Persistence:** Drawings are sent as `PlayerOrder::MinimapDraw` — they appear in replays.
- **Rate limit:** Max 3 drawing strokes per 10 seconds, max 32 points per stroke. Prevents minimap vandalism.

```rust
/// Minimap drawing stroke. Points are quantized to cell resolution
/// to keep order size small. A typical stroke is 8-16 points.
pub struct MinimapStroke {
    pub points: Vec<CellPos>,    // max 32 points
    pub color: PlayerColor,
    pub thickness: u8,           // 1-3 pixels on minimap
    pub placed_at: u64,          // tick for expiration
}
```

**Why this is novel for RTS:** Most RTS games have no minimap drawing. Players resort to rapid pinging to trace paths, which is imprecise and annoying. Minimap drawing enables "draw the attack route" coordination naturally. Some MOBA games (LoL) have minimap drawing; no major RTS does.

#### 4c. Tactical Markers (Persistent Team Annotations)

Unlike pings (ephemeral, 8 seconds) and drawings (ephemeral, 8 seconds), tactical markers are persistent annotations placed by team leaders:

```rust
/// Persistent tactical marker. Lasts until manually removed or game ends.
/// Limited to 10 per player, 30 per team. Intended for strategic planning,
/// not moment-to-moment callouts (that's what pings are for).
pub struct TacticalMarker {
    pub id: MarkerId,
    pub owner: PlayerId,
    pub marker_type: MarkerType,
    pub pos: WorldPos,
    pub label: Option<String>,   // max 16 chars, e.g., "Expand", "Ambush"
    pub placed_at: u64,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug)]
pub enum MarkerType {
    /// Numbered waypoint (1-9). For coordinating multi-prong attacks.
    Waypoint(u8),
    /// Named objective marker. Shows label on the map.
    Objective,
    /// Hazard zone. Renders a colored radius indicating danger area.
    HazardZone { radius: u16 },
}
```

**Access:** Place via ping wheel (hold longer to access marker submenu) or via commands (`/marker waypoint 1`, `/marker objective "Expand here"`, `/marker hazard 50`). Remove with `/marker clear` or right-click on existing marker.

**Use case:** Before a coordinated push, the team leader places waypoint markers 1-3 showing the attack route, an objective marker on the target, and a hazard zone on the enemy's defensive line. These persist until the push is complete, giving the team a shared tactical picture.

#### 4d. Smart Danger Alerts (Novel)

Automatic alerts that supplement manual pings with game-state-aware warnings:

```rust
/// Auto-generated alerts based on sim state. These are NOT orders —
/// they are client-side UI events computed locally from the shared sim state.
/// Each player's client generates its own alerts; no network traffic.
///
/// CRITICAL: All alerts involving enemy state MUST filter through the
/// player's current fog-of-war vision. In standard lockstep, each client
/// has the full sim state — querying enemy positions without vision
/// filtering would be a built-in maphack. The alert system calls
/// `FogProvider::is_visible(player, cell)` before considering any
/// enemy entity. Only enemies the player can currently see trigger alerts.
/// (In fog-authoritative relay mode per V26, this is solved at the data
/// level — the client simply doesn't have hidden enemy state.)
pub enum SmartAlert {
    /// Large enemy force detected moving toward the player's base.
    /// Triggered when >= 5 **visible** enemy units are within N cells of
    /// the base and were not there on the previous check (debounced,
    /// 10-second cooldown). Units hidden by fog of war are excluded.
    IncomingAttack { direction: CompassDirection, unit_count: u32 },
    /// Ally's base is under sustained attack (> 3 buildings damaged in
    /// 10 seconds). Only fires if the attacking units or damaged buildings
    /// are within the player's shared team vision.
    AllyUnderAttack { ally: PlayerId },
    /// Undefended expansion at a known resource location.
    /// Triggered when an ore field has no friendly structures or units nearby.
    /// This alert uses only friendly-side data, so no fog filtering is needed.
    UndefendedResource { pos: WorldPos },
    /// Enemy superweapon charging (if visible). RTS-specific high-urgency alert.
    /// Only fires if the superweapon structure is within the player's vision.
    SuperweaponWarning { weapon_type: String, estimated_ticks: u64 },
}
```

**Why client-side, not sim-side:** Smart alerts are purely informational — they don't affect gameplay. Computing them client-side means zero network cost and zero impact on determinism. Each client already has the full sim state (lockstep), but **alerts must respect fog of war** — only visible enemy units are considered. The `FogProvider` trait (D041) provides the vision query; alerts call `is_visible()` before evaluating any enemy entity. In fog-authoritative relay mode (V26 in `06-SECURITY.md`), this is inherently safe because the client never receives hidden enemy state. The alert thresholds are configurable via D033 QoL toggles.

**Why this is novel:** No RTS engine has context-aware automatic danger alerts. Players currently rely on manual minimap scanning. Smart alerts reduce the cognitive load of map awareness without automating decision-making — they tell you *that* something is happening, not *what to do about it*. This is particularly valuable for newer players who haven't developed the habit of constant minimap checking.

**Competitive consideration:** Smart alerts are a D033 QoL toggle (`alerts.smart_danger: bool`, default `true`). Tournament hosts can disable them for competitive purity. Experience profiles (D033) bundle this toggle with other QoL settings.

### 5. Voice-in-Replay — Architecture & Feasibility

The user asked: "would it make sense technically speaking and otherwise, to keep player voice records in the replay?"

**Yes — technically feasible, precedented, and valuable. But: strictly opt-in with clear consent.**

#### Technical Approach

Voice-in-replay follows ioquake3's proven pattern (the only open-source game with this feature): inject Opus frames as tagged messages into the replay file alongside the order stream.

IC's replay format (`05-FORMATS.md`) already separates streams:
- **Order stream** — deterministic tick frames (for playback)
- **Analysis event stream** — sampled sim state (for stats tools)

Voice adds a third stream:
- **Voice stream** — timestamped Opus frames (for communication context)

```rust
/// Replay file structure with voice stream.
/// Voice is a separate section with its own offset in the header.
/// Tools that don't need voice skip it entirely — zero overhead.
///
/// The voice stream is NOT required for replay playback — it adds
/// communication context, not gameplay data.
pub struct ReplayVoiceStream {
    /// Per-player voice tracks, each independently seekable.
    pub tracks: Vec<VoiceTrack>,
}

pub struct VoiceTrack {
    pub player: PlayerId,
    /// Whether this player consented to voice recording.
    /// If false, this track is empty (header only, no frames).
    pub consented: bool,
    pub frames: Vec<VoiceReplayFrame>,
}

pub struct VoiceReplayFrame {
    /// Game tick when this audio was transmitted.
    pub tick: u64,
    /// Opus-encoded audio data. Same codec as live audio.
    pub opus_data: Vec<u8>,
    /// Original voice target (team/all). Preserved for replay filtering.
    pub target: VoiceTarget,
}
```

**Header extension:** The replay header (`ReplayHeader`) gains a new field:

```rust
pub struct ReplayHeader {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub voice_offset: u32,       // 0 if no voice stream
    pub voice_length: u32,       // Compressed length of voice stream
}
```

The `flags` field gains a `HAS_VOICE` bit. Replay viewers check this flag before attempting to load voice data.

#### Storage Cost

| Game Duration | Players Speaking | Avg Bitrate | DTX Savings | Voice Stream Size |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| 20 min        | 2 of 4           | 32 kbps     | ~40%        | ~1.3 MB           |
| 45 min        | 3 of 8           | 32 kbps     | ~40%        | ~4.7 MB           |
| 60 min        | 4 of 8           | 32 kbps     | ~40%        | ~8.3 MB           |

Compare to the order stream: a 60-minute game's order stream (compressed) is ~2-5 MB. Voice roughly doubles the replay size when all players are recorded. For `Minimal` replays (the default), voice adds 1-8 MB — still well within reasonable file sizes for modern storage.

**Mitigation:** Voice data is LZ4-compressed independently of the order stream. Opus is already compressed (it does not benefit much from generic compression), so LZ4 primarily helps with the framing overhead and silence gaps.

#### Consent Model

**Recording voice in replays is a serious privacy decision.** The design must make consent explicit, informed, and revocable:

1. **Opt-in, not opt-out.** Voice recording for replays is disabled by default. Players enable it via a settings toggle (`replay.record_voice: bool`, default `false`).

2. **Per-session consent display.** When joining a game where ANY player has voice recording enabled, all players see a notification: "Voice may be recorded for replay by: Alice, Bob." This ensures no one is unknowingly recorded.

3. **Per-player granularity.** Each player independently decides whether THEIR voice is recorded. Alice can record her own voice while Bob opts out — Bob's track in the replay is empty.

4. **Relay enforcement.** The relay server tracks each player's recording consent flag. The replay writer (each client) only writes voice frames for consenting players. Even if a malicious client records non-consenting voice locally, the *shared* replay file (relay-signed, D007) contains only consented tracks.

5. **Post-game stripping.** The `/replay strip-voice` command (D058) removes the voice stream from a replay file, producing a voice-free copy. Players can share gameplay replays without voice.

6. **No voice in ranked replays by default.** Ranked match replays submitted for ladder certification (D055) strip voice automatically. Voice is a communication channel, not a gameplay record — it has no bearing on match verification.

7. **Legal compliance.** In jurisdictions requiring two-party consent for recording (e.g., California, Germany), the per-session notification + opt-in model satisfies the consent requirement. Players who haven't enabled recording cannot have their voice captured.

#### Replay Playback with Voice

During replay playback, voice is synchronized to the game tick:

- Voice frames are played at the tick they were originally transmitted
- Fast-forward/rewind seeks the voice stream to the nearest frame boundary
- Voice is mixed into playback audio at a configurable volume (`replay.voice_volume` cvar)
- Individual player voice tracks can be muted/soloed (useful for analysis: "what was Alice saying when she attacked?")
- Voice target filtering: viewer can choose to hear only `All` chat, only `Team` chat, or both

**Use cases for voice-in-replay:**
- **Tournament commentary:** Casters can hear team communication during featured replays (with player consent), adding depth to analysis
- **Coaching:** A coach reviews a student's replay with voice to understand decision-making context
- **Community content:** YouTubers/streamers share replays with natural commentary intact
- **Post-game review:** Players review their own team communication for improvement

### 6. Security Considerations

| Vulnerability               | Risk   | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice spoofing**          | HIGH   | Relay stamps `speaker: PlayerId` on all forwarded voice packets. Client-submitted speaker ID is overwritten. Same pattern as ioquake3 server-side VoIP.                                                          |
| **Voice DDoS**              | MEDIUM | Rate limit: max 50 voice packets/sec per player (relay-enforced). Bandwidth cap: `MessageLane::Voice` has a 16 KB buffer — overflow drops oldest frames. Exceeding rate limit triggers mute + warning.           |
| **Voice data in replays**   | HIGH   | Opt-in consent model (see § 5). Voice tracks only written for consenting players. `/replay strip-voice` for post-hoc removal. No voice in ranked replays by default.                                             |
| **Ping spam / toxicity**    | MEDIUM | Max 3 pings per 5 seconds per player. Diminishing audio on rapid pings. Report pathway for ping abuse.                                                                                                           |
| **Chat flood**              | LOW    | 5 messages per 3 seconds (relay-enforced). Slow mode indicator. Already addressed by ProtocolLimits (V15).                                                                                                       |
| **Minimap drawing abuse**   | LOW    | Max 3 strokes per 10 seconds, 32 points per stroke. Drawings are team-only. Report pathway.                                                                                                                      |
| **Whisper harassment**      | MEDIUM | Player-level mute persists across sessions (SQLite, D034). Whisper requires mutual non-mute (if either party has muted the other, whisper is silently dropped). Report → admin mute pathway.                     |
| **Observer voice coaching** | HIGH   | In competitive/ranked games, observers cannot transmit voice to players. Observer `VoiceTarget::All/Team` is restricted to observer-only routing. Same isolation as observer chat.                               |
| **Content in voice data**   | MEDIUM | IC does not moderate voice content in real-time (no speech-to-text analysis). Moderation is reactive: player reports + replay review. Community server admins (D052) can review voice replays of reported games. |

**New ProtocolLimits fields:**

```rust
pub struct ProtocolLimits {
    // ... existing fields (V15) ...
    pub max_voice_packets_per_second: u32,    // 50 (1 per 20ms frame)
    pub max_voice_packet_size: usize,         // 256 bytes (covers single-frame 64kbps Opus
                                              // = ~160 byte payload + headers. Multi-frame
                                              // bundles (frame_count > 1) send multiple packets,
                                              // not one oversized packet.)
    pub max_pings_per_interval: u32,          // 3 per 5 seconds
    pub max_minimap_draw_points: usize,       // 32 per stroke
    pub max_tactical_markers_per_player: u8,  // 10
    pub max_tactical_markers_per_team: u8,    // 30
}
```

### 7. Platform Considerations

| Platform            | Text Chat     | VoIP                     | Pings               | Chat Wheel          | Minimap Draw  |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| **Desktop**         | Full keyboard | PTT or VAD; Opus/UDP     | G key + wheel       | V key + wheel       | Alt+drag      |
| **Browser (WASM)**  | Full keyboard | PTT; Opus/WebRTC (str0m) | Same                | Same                | Same          |
| **Steam Deck**      | On-screen KB  | PTT on trigger/bumper    | D-pad or touchpad   | D-pad submenu       | Touch minimap |
| **Mobile (future)** | On-screen KB  | PTT button on screen     | Tap-hold on minimap | Radial menu on hold | Finger draw   |

### 8. Lua API Extensions (D024)

Building on the existing `Beacon` and `Radar` globals from OpenRA compatibility:

```lua
-- Existing OpenRA globals (unchanged)
Beacon.New(owner, pos, duration, palette, isPlayerPalette)
Radar.Ping(player, pos, color, duration)

-- IC extensions
Ping.Place(player, pos, pingType)          -- Place a typed ping
Ping.PlaceOnTarget(player, target, pingType) -- Ping tracking an entity
Ping.Clear(player)                          -- Clear all pings from player
Ping.ClearAll()                             -- Clear all pings (mission use)

ChatWheel.Send(player, phraseId)           -- Trigger a chat wheel phrase
ChatWheel.RegisterPhrase(id, translations) -- Register a custom phrase

Marker.Place(player, pos, markerType, label) -- Place tactical marker
Marker.Remove(player, markerId)              -- Remove a marker
Marker.ClearAll(player)                      -- Clear all markers

Chat.Send(player, channel, message)        -- Send a chat message
Chat.SendToAll(player, message)            -- Convenience: all-chat
Chat.SendToTeam(player, message)           -- Convenience: team-chat
```

**Mission scripting use cases:** Lua mission scripts can place scripted pings ("attack this target"), send narrated chat messages (briefing text during gameplay), and manage tactical markers (pre-placed waypoints for mission objectives). The `Chat.Send` function enables bot-style NPC communication in co-op scenarios.

### 9. Console Commands (D058 Integration)

All coordination features are accessible via the command console:

```
/all <message>           # Send to all-chat
/team <message>          # Send to team chat  
/w <player> <message>    # Whisper to player
/mute <player>           # Mute player (voice + text)
/unmute <player>         # Unmute player
/mutelist                # Show muted players
/voice volume <0-100>    # Set incoming voice volume
/voice ptt <key>         # Set push-to-talk key
/voice toggle            # Toggle voice on/off
/voice diag              # Open voice diagnostics overlay
/voice effect list       # List available effect presets (built-in + Workshop)
/voice effect set <name> # Apply effect preset (e.g., "Military Radio")
/voice effect off        # Disable voice effects
/voice effect preview <name>  # Play sample clip with effect applied
/voice effect info <name>     # Show preset details (stages, CPU estimate, author)
/voice isolation toggle  # Toggle enhanced voice isolation (receiver-side double-pass)
/ping <type> [x] [y]     # Place a ping (type: attack, defend, danger, etc.)
/ping clear              # Clear your pings
/draw                    # Toggle minimap drawing mode
/marker <type> [label]   # Place tactical marker at cursor
/marker clear [id|all]   # Remove marker(s)
/wheel <phrase_id>       # Send chat wheel phrase by ID
/replay strip-voice <file> # Remove voice from replay file
```

### Alternatives Considered

- **External voice only (Discord/TeamSpeak/Mumble)** (rejected — external voice is the status quo for OpenRA and it's the #1 friction point for new players. Forcing third-party voice excludes casual players, fragments the community, and makes beacons/pings impossible to synchronize with voice. Built-in voice is table stakes for a modern multiplayer game. However, deep analysis of Mumble's protocol, Janus SFU, and str0m's sans-I/O WebRTC directly informed IC's VoIP design — see `research/open-source-voip-analysis.md` for the full survey.)
- **P2P voice instead of relay-forwarded** (rejected — P2P voice exposes player IP addresses to all participants. This is a known harassment vector: competitive players have been DDoS'd via IPs obtained from game voice. Relay-forwarded voice maintains D007's IP privacy guarantee. The bandwidth cost is negligible for the relay.)
- **WebRTC for all platforms** (rejected — WebRTC's complexity (ICE negotiation, STUN/TURN, DTLS) is unnecessary overhead for native desktop clients that already have a UDP connection to the relay. Raw Opus-over-UDP is simpler, lower latency, and sufficient. WebRTC is used only for browser builds where raw UDP is unavailable.)
- **Voice activation (VAD) as default** (rejected — VAD transmits background noise, keyboard sounds, and private conversations. Every competitive game that tried VAD-by-default reverted to PTT-by-default. VAD remains available as a user preference for casual play.)
- **Voice moderation via speech-to-text** (rejected — real-time STT is compute-intensive, privacy-invasive, unreliable across accents/languages, and creates false positive moderation actions. Reactive moderation via reports + voice replay review is more appropriate. IC is not a social platform with tens of millions of users — community-scale moderation (D037/D052) is sufficient.)
- **Always-on voice recording in replays** (rejected — recording without consent is a privacy violation in many jurisdictions. Even with consent, always-on recording creates storage overhead for every game. Opt-in recording is the correct default. ioquake3 records voice in demos by default, but ioquake3 predates modern privacy law.)
- **Opus alternative: Lyra/Codec2** (rejected — Lyra is a Google ML-based codec with excellent compression (3 kbps) but requires ML model distribution, is not WASM-friendly, and has no Rust bindings. Codec2 is designed for amateur radio with lower quality than Opus at comparable bitrates. Opus is the industry standard, has mature Rust bindings, and is universally supported.)
- **Custom ping types per mod** (partially accepted — the engine defines the 8 core ping types; game modules can register additional types via YAML. This avoids UI inconsistency while allowing mod creativity. Custom ping types inherit the rate-limiting and visual framework.)
- **Sender-side voice effects** (rejected — applying DSP effects before Opus encoding wastes codec bits on the effect rather than the voice, degrades quality, and forces the sender's aesthetic choice on all listeners. Receiver-side effects let each player choose their own experience while preserving clean audio for replays and broadcast.)
- **External DSP library (fundsp/dasp) for voice effects** (deferred — the built-in DSP stages (biquad, compressor, soft-clip, noise gate, reverb, de-esser) are ~500 lines of straightforward Rust. External libraries add dependency weight for operations that don't need their generality. If future effects require convolution reverb or FFT-based processing, `fundsp` becomes a justified addition.)
- **Voice morphing / pitch shifting** (deferred — AI-powered voice morphing (deeper voice, gender shifting, character voices) is technically feasible but raises toxicity concerns: voice morphing enables identity manipulation in team games. Competitive games that implemented voice morphing (Fortnite's party effects) limit it to cosmetic fun modes. IC could add this as a Phase 7 Workshop resource type with appropriate social guardrails — deferred, not rejected.)
- **Shared audio channels / proximity voice** (deferred — proximity voice where you hear players based on their units' positions is interesting for immersive scenarios but confusing for competitive play. The `SPATIAL` flag provides spatial panning as a toggle-able approximation. Full proximity voice could be added in Phase 7 as an optional game mode feature.)

### Integration with Existing Decisions

- **D006 (NetworkModel):** Voice is not a NetworkModel concern — it is an `ic-net` service that sits alongside `NetworkModel`, using the same `Transport` connection but on a separate `MessageLane`. `NetworkModel` handles orders; voice forwarding is independent.
- **D007 (Relay Server):** Voice packets are relay-forwarded, maintaining IP privacy and consistent routing. The relay's voice forwarding is stateless — it copies bytes without decoding Opus. The relay's rate limiting (per-player voice packet cap) defends against voice DDoS.
- **D024 (Lua API):** IC extends Beacon and Radar globals with `Ping`, `ChatWheel`, `Marker`, and `Chat` globals. OpenRA beacon/radar calls map to IC's ping system with `PingType::Generic`.
- **D033 (QoL Toggles):** Spatial audio, voice effects (preset selection), enhanced voice isolation, smart danger alerts, ping sounds, voice recording are individually toggleable. Experience profiles (D033) bundle communication preferences — e.g., an "Immersive" profile enables spatial audio + Military Radio voice effect + smart danger alerts.
- **D054 (Transport):** On native builds, voice uses the same `Transport` trait connection as orders — Opus frames are sent on `MessageLane::Voice` over `UdpTransport`. On browser builds, voice uses a parallel `str0m` WebRTC session *alongside* (not through) the `Transport` trait, because browser audio capture/playback requires WebRTC media APIs. The relay bridges between the two: it receives voice from native clients on `MessageLane::Voice` and from browser clients via WebRTC, then forwards to each recipient using their respective transport. The `VoiceTransport` enum (`Native` / `WebRtc`) selects the appropriate path per platform.
- **D055 (Ranked Matchmaking):** Voice is stripped from ranked replay submissions. Chat and pings are preserved (they are orders in the deterministic stream).
- **D058 (Chat/Command Console):** All coordination features are accessible via console commands. D058 defined the input system; D059 defines the routing, voice, spatial signaling, and voice effect selection that D058's commands control. The `/all`, `/team`, `/w` commands were placeholder in D058 — D059 specifies their routing implementation. Voice effect commands (`/voice effect list`, `/voice effect set`, `/voice effect preview`) give console-first access to the voice effects system.
- **05-FORMATS.md (Replay Format):** Voice stream extends the replay file format with a new section. The replay header gains `voice_offset`/`voice_length` fields and a `HAS_VOICE` flag bit. Voice is independent of the order and analysis streams — tools that don't process voice ignore it.
- **06-SECURITY.md:** New `ProtocolLimits` fields for voice, ping, and drawing rate limits. Voice spoofing prevention (relay-stamped speaker ID). Voice-in-replay consent model addresses privacy requirements.
- **D010 (Snapshots) / Analysis Event Stream:** The replay analysis event stream now includes **camera position samples** (`CameraPositionSample`), **selection tracking** (`SelectionChanged`), **control group events** (`ControlGroupEvent`), **ability usage** (`AbilityUsed`), **pause events** (`PauseEvent`), and **match end events** (`MatchEnded`) — see `05-FORMATS.md` § "Analysis Event Stream" for the full enum. Camera samples are lightweight (~8 bytes per player per sample at 2 Hz = ~1 KB/min for 8 players). D059 notes this integration because voice-in-replay is most valuable when combined with camera tracking — hearing what a player said while seeing what they were looking at.
- **03-NETCODE.md (Match Lifecycle):** D059's competitive voice rules (pause behavior, eliminated player routing, ranked restrictions, coach slot) integrate with the match lifecycle protocol defined in `03-NETCODE.md` § "Match Lifecycle." Voice pause behavior follows the game pause state — voice continues during pause per D059's competitive voice rules. Surrender and disconnect events affect voice routing (eliminated-to-observer transition). The **In-Match Vote Framework** (`03-NETCODE.md` § "In-Match Vote Framework") extends D059's tactical coordination: tactical polls build on the chat wheel phrase system (`poll: true` phrases in `chat_wheel_phrases.yaml`), and `/callvote` commands are registered via D058's Brigadier command tree. See vote framework research: `research/vote-callvote-system-analysis.md`.

### Shared Infrastructure: Voice, Game Netcode & Workshop Cross-Pollination

IC's voice system (D059), game netcode (`03-NETCODE.md`), and Workshop distribution (D030/D049/D050) share underlying networking patterns. This section documents concrete improvements that flow between them — shared infrastructure that avoids duplicate work and strengthens all three systems.

#### Unified Connection Quality Monitor

Both voice (D059's `VoiceBitrateAdapter`) and game netcode (`03-NETCODE.md` § Adaptive Run-Ahead) independently monitor connection quality to adapt their behavior. Voice adjusts Opus bitrate based on packet loss and RTT. Game adjusts order submission timing based on relay timing feedback. Both systems need the same measurements — yet without coordination, they probe independently.

**Improvement:** A single `ConnectionQuality` resource in `ic-net`, updated by the relay connection, feeds both systems:

```rust
/// Shared connection quality state — updated by the relay connection,
/// consumed by voice, game netcode, and Workshop download scheduler.
#[derive(Resource)]
pub struct ConnectionQuality {
    pub rtt_ms: u32,                  // smoothed RTT (EWMA)
    pub rtt_variance_ms: u32,         // jitter estimate
    pub packet_loss_pct: u8,          // 0-100, rolling window
    pub bandwidth_estimate_kbps: u32, // estimated available bandwidth
    pub quality_tier: QualityTier,    // derived summary for quick decisions
}

pub enum QualityTier {
    Excellent,  // <30ms RTT, <1% loss
    Good,       // <80ms RTT, <3% loss
    Fair,       // <150ms RTT, <5% loss  
    Poor,       // <300ms RTT, <10% loss
    Critical,   // >300ms RTT or >10% loss
}
```

**Who benefits:**
- **Voice:** `VoiceBitrateAdapter` reads `ConnectionQuality` instead of maintaining its own RTT/loss measurements. Bitrate decisions align with the game connection's actual state.
- **Game netcode:** Adaptive run-ahead uses the same smoothed RTT that voice uses, ensuring consistent latency estimation across systems.
- **Workshop downloads:** Large package downloads (D049) can throttle based on `bandwidth_estimate_kbps` during gameplay — never competing with order delivery or voice. Downloads pause automatically when `quality_tier` drops to `Poor` or `Critical`.

#### Voice Jitter Buffer ↔ Game Order Buffering

D059's adaptive jitter buffer (EWMA-based target depth, packet loss concealment) solves the same fundamental problem as game order delivery: variable-latency packet arrival that must be smoothed into regular consumption.

**Voice → Game improvement:** The jitter buffer's adaptive EWMA algorithm can inform the game's run-ahead calculation. Currently, adaptive run-ahead adjusts order submission timing based on relay feedback. The voice jitter buffer's `target_depth` — computed from the same connection's actual packet arrival variance — provides a more responsive signal: if voice packets are arriving with high jitter, game order submission should also pad its timing.

**Game → Voice improvement:** The game netcode's token-based liveness check (nonce echo, `03-NETCODE.md` § Anti-Lag-Switch) detects frozen clients within one missed token. The voice system should use the same liveness signal — if the game connection's token check fails (client frozen), the voice system can immediately switch to PLC (Opus Packet Loss Concealment) rather than waiting for voice packet timeouts. This reduces the detection-to-concealment latency from ~200ms (voice timeout) to ~33ms (one game tick).

#### Lane Priority & Voice/Order Bandwidth Arbitration

D059 uses `MessageLane::Voice` (priority tier 1, weight 2) alongside game orders (`MessageLane::Orders`, priority tier 0). The lane system already prevents voice from starving orders. But the interaction can be tighter:

**Improvement:** When `ConnectionQuality.quality_tier` drops to `Poor`, the voice system should proactively reduce bitrate *before* the lane system needs to drop voice packets. The sequence:
1. `ConnectionQuality` detects degradation
2. `VoiceBitrateAdapter` drops to minimum bitrate (16 kbps) preemptively
3. Lane scheduler sees reduced voice traffic, allocates freed bandwidth to order reliability (retransmits)
4. When quality recovers, voice ramps back up over 2 seconds

This is better than the current design where voice and orders compete reactively — the voice system cooperates proactively because it reads the same quality signal.

#### Workshop P2P Distribution ↔ Spectator Feeds

D049's BitTorrent/WebTorrent infrastructure for Workshop package distribution can serve double duty:

**Spectator feed fan-out:** When a popular tournament match has 500+ spectators, the relay server becomes a bandwidth bottleneck (broadcasting delayed `TickOrders` to all spectators). Workshop's P2P distribution pattern solves this: the relay sends the spectator feed to N seed peers, who redistribute to other spectators via WebTorrent. The feed is chunked by tick range (matching the replay format's 256-tick LZ4 blocks) — each chunk is a small torrent piece that peers can share immediately after receiving it.

**Replay distribution:** Tournament replays often see thousands of downloads in the first hour. Instead of serving from a central server, popular `.icrep` files can use Workshop's BitTorrent distribution — the replay file format's block structure (header + per-256-tick LZ4 chunks) maps naturally to torrent pieces.

#### Unified Cryptographic Identity

Five systems independently use Ed25519 signing:
1. **Game netcode** — relay server signs `CertifiedMatchResult` (D007)
2. **Voice** — relay stamps speaker ID on forwarded voice packets (D059)
3. **Replay** — signature chain hashes each tick (05-FORMATS.md)
4. **Workshop** — package signatures (D049)
5. **Community servers** — SCR credential records (D052)

**Improvement:** A single `IdentityProvider` in `ic-net` manages the relay's signing key and exposes a `sign(payload: &[u8])` method. All five systems call this instead of independently managing `ed25519_dalek` instances. Key rotation (required for long-running servers) happens in one place. The `SignatureScheme` enum (D054) gates algorithm selection for all five systems uniformly.

#### Voice Preprocessing ↔ Workshop Audio Content

D059's audio preprocessing pipeline (noise suppression via `nnnoiseless`, echo cancellation via `speexdsp-rs`, Opus encoding via `audiopus`) is a complete audio processing chain that has value beyond real-time voice:

**Workshop audio quality tool:** Content creators producing voice packs, announcer mods, and sound effect packs for the Workshop can use the same preprocessing pipeline as a quality normalization tool (`ic audio normalize`). This ensures Workshop audio content meets consistent quality standards (sample rate, loudness, noise floor) without requiring creators to own professional audio software.

**Workshop voice effect presets:** The DSP stages used in voice effects (biquad filters, compressors, reverb, distortion) are shared infrastructure between the real-time voice effects chain and the `ic audio effect` CLI tools. Content creators developing custom voice effect presets use the same `ic audio effect preview` and `ic audio effect validate` commands that the engine uses to instantiate chains at runtime. The YAML preset format is a Workshop resource type — presets are published, versioned, rated, and discoverable through the same Workshop browser as maps and mods.

#### Adaptive Quality Is the Shared Pattern

The meta-pattern across all three systems is **adaptive quality degradation** — gracefully reducing fidelity when resources are constrained, rather than failing:

| System             | Constrained Resource      | Degradation Response                           | Recovery                               |

| **Voice**          | Bandwidth/loss            | Reduce Opus bitrate (32→16 kbps), increase FEC | Ramp back over 2s                      |
| **Game**           | Latency                   | Increase run-ahead, pad order submission       | Reduce run-ahead as RTT improves       |
| **Workshop**       | Bandwidth during gameplay | Pause/throttle downloads                       | Resume at full speed post-game         |
| **Spectator feed** | Relay bandwidth           | Switch to P2P fan-out, reduce feed rate        | Return to relay-direct when load drops |
| **Replay**         | Storage                   | `Minimal` embedding mode (no map/assets)       | `SelfContained` when storage allows    |

All five responses share the same trigger signal (`ConnectionQuality`), the same reaction pattern (reduce → adapt → recover), and the same design philosophy (D015's efficiency pyramid — better algorithms before more resources). Building them on shared infrastructure ensures they cooperate rather than compete.

## D060: Netcode Parameter Philosophy — Automate Everything, Expose Almost Nothing

**Status:** Settled  
**Decided:** 2026-02  
**Scope:** `ic-net`, `ic-game` (lobby), D058 (console)  
**Phase:** Phase 5 (Multiplayer)

### Context

Every lockstep RTS has tunable netcode parameters: tick rate, command delay (run-ahead), game speed, sync check frequency, stall policy, and more. The question is which parameters to expose to players, which to expose to server admins, and which to keep as fixed engine constants.

This decision was informed by a cross-game survey of configurable netcode parameters — covering both RTS (C&C Generals, StarCraft/Brood War, Spring Engine, 0 A.D., OpenTTD, Factorio, Age of Empires II, original Red Alert) and FPS (Counter-Strike 2) — plus analysis of IC's own sub-tick and adaptive run-ahead systems.

### The Pattern: Successful Games Automate

Every commercially successful game in the survey converged on the same answer: **automate netcode parameters, expose almost nothing to players.**

| Game / Engine            | Player-Facing Netcode Controls                        | Automatic Systems                                                                            | Outcome                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C&C Generals/ZH**      | Game speed only                                       | Adaptive run-ahead (200-sample rolling RTT + FPS), synchronized `RUNAHEAD` command           | Players never touch latency settings; game adapts silently                    |
| **Factorio**             | None (game speed implicit)                            | Latency hiding (always-on since 0.14.0, toggle removed), server never waits for slow clients | Removed the only toggle because "always on" was always better                 |
| **Counter-Strike 2**     | None                                                  | Sub-tick always-on; fixed 64 Hz tick (removed 64/128 choice from CS:GO)                      | Removed tick rate choice because sub-tick made it irrelevant                  |
| **AoE II: DE**           | Game speed only                                       | Auto-adapts command delay based on connection quality                                        | No exposed latency controls in ranked                                         |
| **Original Red Alert**   | Game speed only                                       | MaxAhead adapts automatically every 128 frames via host `TIMING` events                      | Players never interact with MaxAhead; formula-driven                          |
| **StarCraft: Brood War** | Game speed + latency setting (Low/High/Extra High)    | None (static command delay per setting)                                                      | Latency setting confuses new players; competitive play mandates "Low Latency" |
| **Spring Engine**        | Game speed (host) + LagProtection mode (server admin) | Dynamic speed adjustment based on CPU reporting; two speed control modes                     | More controls → more community complaints about netcode                       |
| **0 A.D.**               | None                                                  | None (hardcoded 200ms turns, no adaptive run-ahead, stalls for everyone)                     | Least adaptive → most stalling complaints                                     |

**The correlation is clear:** games that expose fewer netcode controls and invest in automatic adaptation have fewer player complaints and better perceived netcode quality. Games that expose latency settings (BW) or lack automatic adaptation (0 A.D.) have worse player experiences.

### Decision

IC adopts a **three-tier exposure model** for netcode parameters:

#### Tier 1: Player-Facing (Lobby GUI)

| Setting        | Values                                       | Default          | Who Sets     | Scope                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| **Game Speed** | Slowest / Slower / Normal / Faster / Fastest | Slower (~15 tps) | Host (lobby) | Synced — all clients |

One setting. Game speed is the only parameter where player preference is legitimate ("I like slower, more strategic games" vs. "I prefer fast-paced gameplay"). In ranked play, game speed is server-enforced and not configurable.

Game speed affects only the interval between sim ticks — system behavior is tick-count-based, so all game logic works identically at any speed. Single-player can change speed mid-game; multiplayer sets it in lobby. This matches how every C&C game handled speed (see `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` § Game Speed).

#### Tier 2: Advanced / Console (Power Users, D058)

Available via console commands or `config.yaml`. Not in the main GUI. Flagged with appropriate cvar flags:

| Cvar                     | Type  | Default | Flags        | What It Does                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `net.sync_frequency`     | int   | 120     | `SERVER`     | Ticks between full state hash checks                                               |
| `net.desync_debug_level` | int   | 0       | `DEV_ONLY`   | 0-3, controls desync diagnosis overhead (see `03-NETCODE.md` § Debug Levels)       |
| `net.show_diagnostics`   | bool  | false   | `PERSISTENT` | Toggle network overlay (latency, jitter, packet loss, tick timing)                 |
| `net.visual_prediction`  | bool  | true    | `DEV_ONLY`   | Client-side visual prediction; disabling useful only for testing perceived latency |
| `net.simulate_latency`   | int   | 0       | `DEV_ONLY`   | Artificial one-way latency in ms (debug builds only)                               |
| `net.simulate_loss`      | float | 0.0     | `DEV_ONLY`   | Artificial packet loss percentage (debug builds only)                              |
| `net.simulate_jitter`    | int   | 0       | `DEV_ONLY`   | Artificial jitter in ms (debug builds only)                                        |

These are diagnostic and testing tools, not gameplay knobs. The `DEV_ONLY` flag prevents them from affecting ranked play. The `SERVER` flag on `sync_frequency` ensures all clients use the same value.

#### Tier 3: Engine Constants (Not Configurable at Runtime)

| Parameter              | Value                                 | Why Fixed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sim tick rate**      | 30 tps (33ms/tick)                    | In lockstep, ticks are synchronization barriers (collect orders → process → advance sim → exchange hashes), not just simulation steps. Higher rates multiply CPU cost (full ECS update per tick for 500+ units), network overhead (more sync barriers, larger run-ahead in ticks), and late-arrival risk — with no gameplay benefit. RTS units move cell-to-cell, not sub-millimeter. Visual interpolation makes 30 tps smooth at 60+ FPS render. Game speed multiplies the tick *interval*, not the tick *rate*. See `03-NETCODE.md` § "Why Sub-Tick Instead of a Higher Tick Rate" |
| **Sub-tick ordering**  | Always on                             | Zero cost (~4 bytes/order + one sort of ≤5 items); produces visibly fairer outcomes in simultaneous-action edge cases; CS2 proved universal acceptance; no reason to toggle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Adaptive run-ahead** | Always on                             | Generals proved this works over 20 years; adapts to both RTT and FPS; synchronized via network command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Timing feedback**    | Always on                             | Client self-calibrates order submission timing based on relay feedback; DDNet-proven pattern                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Anti-lag-switch**    | Always on                             | Relay owns the clock; non-negotiable for competitive integrity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Sub-Tick Is Not Optional

Sub-tick order fairness (D008) is **always-on** — not a configurable feature:

- **Cost:** ~4 bytes per order (`sub_tick_time: u32`) + one stable sort per tick of the orders array (typically 0-5 orders — negligible).
- **Benefit:** Fairer resolution of simultaneous events (engineer races, crate grabs, simultaneous attacks). "I clicked first, I won" matches player intuition.
- **Player experience:** The mechanism is automatic (players don't configure timestamps), but the outcome is **very visible** — who wins the engineer race, who grabs the contested crate, whose attack order resolves first. These moments define close games. Without sub-tick, ties are broken by player ID (always unfair to higher-numbered players) or packet arrival order (network-dependent randomness). With sub-tick, the player who acted first wins. That's a gameplay experience players notice and care about.
- **If made optional:** Would require two code paths in the sim (sorted vs. unsorted order processing), a deterministic fallback that's always unfair to higher-numbered players (player ID tiebreak), and a lobby setting nobody understands. Ranked would mandate one mode anyway. CS2 faced zero community backlash — no one asked for "the old random tie-breaking."

### Rationale

**Netcode parameters are not like graphics settings.** Graphics preferences are subjective (some players prefer performance over visual quality). Netcode parameters have objectively correct values — or correct adaptive algorithms. Exposing the knob creates confusion:

1. **Support burden:** "My game feels laggy" → "What's your tick rate set to?" → "I changed some settings and now I don't know which one broke it."
2. **False blame:** Players blame netcode settings when the real issue is their WiFi or ISP. Exposing knobs gives them something to fiddle with instead of addressing the root cause.
3. **Competitive fragmentation:** If netcode parameters are configurable, tournaments must mandate specific values. Different communities pick different values. Replays from one community don't feel the same on another's settings.
4. **Testing matrix explosion:** Every configurable parameter multiplies the QA matrix. Sub-tick on/off × 5 sync frequencies × 3 debug levels = 30 configurations to test.

The games that got this right — Generals, Factorio, CS2 — all converged on the same philosophy: **invest in adaptive algorithms, not exposed knobs.**

### Alternatives Considered

- **Expose tick rate as a lobby setting** (rejected — unlike game speed, tick rate affects CPU cost, bandwidth, and netcode timing in ways players can't reason about. If 30 tps causes issues on low-end hardware, that's a game speed problem (lower speed = lower effective tps), not a tick rate problem.)
- **Expose latency setting like StarCraft BW** (rejected — BW's Low/High/Extra High was necessary because the game had no adaptive run-ahead. IC has adaptive run-ahead from Generals. The manual setting is replaced by a better automatic system.)
- **Expose sub-tick as a toggle** (rejected — see analysis above. Zero-cost, always-fairer, produces visibly better outcomes in contested actions, CS2 precedent.)
- **Expose everything in "Advanced Network Settings" panel** (rejected — the Spring Engine approach. More controls correlate with more complaints, not fewer.)

### Integration with Existing Decisions

- **D006 (Pluggable Networking):** The `NetworkModel` trait encapsulates all netcode behavior. Parameters are internal to each implementation, not exposed through the trait interface. `LocalNetwork` ignores network parameters entirely (zero delay, no adaptation needed). `RelayLockstepNetwork` manages run-ahead, timing feedback, and anti-lag-switch internally.
- **D007 (Relay Server):** The relay's tick deadline, strike thresholds, and session limits are server admin configuration, not player settings. These map to relay config files, not lobby GUI.
- **D008 (Sub-Tick Timestamps):** Explicitly non-optional per this decision.
- **D015 (Efficiency-First Performance):** Adaptive algorithms (run-ahead, timing feedback) are the "better algorithms" tier of the efficiency pyramid — they solve the problem before reaching for brute-force approaches.
- **D033 (Toggleable QoL):** Game speed is the one netcode-adjacent setting that fits D033's toggle model. All other netcode parameters are engineering constants, not user preferences.

### Problem

Every game that stores player data eventually faces the same question: "How do I move my stuff to a new computer?" The answer ranges from terrible (hunt for hidden AppData folders, hope you got the right files) to opaque (proprietary cloud sync that works until it doesn't). IC's local-first architecture (D034, D053) means all player data already lives on the player's machine — which is both the opportunity and the responsibility. If everything is local, losing that data means losing everything: campaign progress, competitive history, replay collection, social connections.

The design must satisfy three requirements:
1. **Backup:** A player can create a complete, restorable snapshot of all their IC data.
2. **Portability:** A player can move their data to another machine or a fresh install and resume exactly where they left off.
3. **Data export:** A player can extract their data in standard, human-readable formats (GDPR Article 20 compliance, and just good practice).

### Design Principles

1. **"Just copy the folder" must work.** The data directory is self-contained. No registry entries, no hidden temp folders, no external database connections. A manual copy of `<data_dir>/` is a valid (if crude) backup.
2. **Standard formats only.** ZIP for archives, SQLite for databases, PNG for images, YAML/JSON for configuration. No proprietary backup format. A player should be able to inspect their own data with standard tools (DB Browser for SQLite, any image viewer, any text editor).
3. **No IC-hosted cloud.** IC does not operate cloud storage. Cloud sync is opt-in through existing platform services (Steam Cloud, GOG Galaxy). This avoids infrastructure cost, liability, and the temptation to make player data hostage to a service.
4. **SCRs are inherently portable.** Signed Credential Records (D052) are self-verifying — they carry the community public key, payload, and Ed25519 signature. A player's verified ratings, achievements, and community memberships work on any IC install without re-earning or re-validating. This is IC's unique advantage over every competitor.
5. **Backup is a first-class CLI feature.** Not buried in a settings menu, not a third-party tool. `ic backup create` is a documented, supported command.

### Data Directory Layout

All player data lives under a single, stable, documented directory. The layout is defined at Phase 0 (directory structure), stabilized by Phase 2 (save/replay formats finalized), and fully populated by Phase 5 (multiplayer profile data).

**Platform-specific `<data_dir>` resolution:**

| Platform       | Default Location                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows        | `%APPDATA%\IronCurtain\`                                                 |
| macOS          | `~/Library/Application Support/IronCurtain/`                             |
| Linux          | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/iron-curtain/` (default: `~/.local/share/iron-curtain/`) |
| Steam Deck     | Same as Linux                                                            |
| Browser (WASM) | OPFS virtual filesystem (see `05-FORMATS.md` § Browser Storage)          |
| Mobile         | App sandbox (platform-managed)                                           |

**Override:** `IC_DATA_DIR` environment variable or `--data-dir` CLI flag overrides the default. Useful for portable installs (USB drive), multi-account testing, or custom backup scripts.

### Backup System: `ic backup` CLI

The `ic backup` CLI provides safe, consistent backups. Following the Fossilize-inspired CLI philosophy (D020 — each subcommand does one focused thing well):

```
ic backup create                              # Full backup → <data_dir>/backups/ic-backup-<date>.zip
ic backup create --output ~/my-backup.zip     # Custom output path
ic backup create --exclude replays,workshop   # Smaller backup — skip large data
ic backup create --only keys,profile,saves    # Targeted backup — critical data only
ic backup restore ic-backup-2027-03-15.zip    # Restore from backup (prompts on conflict)
ic backup restore backup.zip --overwrite      # Restore without prompting
ic backup list                                # List available backups with size and date
ic backup verify ic-backup-2027-03-15.zip     # Verify archive integrity without restoring
```

**How `ic backup create` works:**

1. **SQLite databases:** Each `.db` file is backed up using `VACUUM INTO '<temp>.db'` — this creates a consistent, compacted copy without requiring the database to be closed. WAL checkpoints are folded in. No risk of copying a half-written WAL file.
2. **Binary files:** `.icsave`, `.icrep`, `.icpkg` files are copied as-is (they're self-contained).
3. **Image files:** PNG screenshots are copied as-is.
4. **Config files:** `config.yaml` and any other YAML files are copied as-is.
5. **Key files:** `keys/identity.key` is included (the player's private key — also recoverable via mnemonic seed phrase, but a full backup preserves everything).
6. **Package:** Everything is bundled into a ZIP archive with the original directory structure preserved. No compression on already-compressed files (`.icsave`, `.icrep` are LZ4-compressed internally).

**Backup categories for `--exclude` and `--only`:**

| Category       | Contents                       | Typical Size   | Critical?                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `keys`         | `keys/identity.key`            | < 1 KB         | **Yes** — recoverable via mnemonic seed phrase |
| `profile`      | `profile.db`                   | < 1 MB         | **Yes** — friends, settings, avatar            |
| `communities`  | `communities/*.db`             | 1–10 MB        | **Yes** — ratings, match history (SCRs)        |
| `achievements` | `achievements.db`              | < 1 MB         | **Yes** — SCR-backed achievement proofs        |
| `config`       | `config.yaml`                  | < 100 KB       | Medium — preferences, easily recreated         |
| `saves`        | `saves/*.icsave`               | 10–100 MB      | High — campaign progress, in-progress games    |
| `replays`      | `replays/*.icrep`              | 100 MB – 10 GB | Low — sentimental, not functional              |
| `screenshots`  | `screenshots/*.png`            | 10 MB – 5 GB   | Low — sentimental, not functional              |
| `workshop`     | `workshop/` (cache + packages) | 100 MB – 50 GB | None — re-downloadable                         |
| `gameplay`     | `gameplay.db`                  | 10–100 MB      | Medium — event log, catalogs (rebuildable)     |
| `mods`         | `mods/`                        | Variable       | Low — re-downloadable or re-installable        |
| `maps`         | `maps/`                        | Variable       | Low — re-downloadable                          |

**Default `ic backup create`** includes: `keys`, `profile`, `communities`, `achievements`, `config`, `saves`, `replays`, `screenshots`, `gameplay`. Excludes `workshop`, `mods`, `maps` (re-downloadable). Total size for a typical player: 200 MB – 2 GB.

### Profile Export: JSON Data Portability

For GDPR Article 20 compliance and general good practice, IC provides a machine-readable profile export:

```
ic profile export                             # → <data_dir>/exports/profile-export-<date>.json
ic profile export --format json               # Explicit format (JSON is default)
```

**Export contents:**

```json
{
  "export_version": "1.0",
  "exported_at": "2027-03-15T14:30:00Z",
  "engine_version": "0.5.0",
  "identity": {
    "display_name": "CommanderZod",
    "public_key": "ed25519:abc123...",
    "bio": "Tank rush enthusiast since 1996",
    "title": "Iron Commander",
    "country": "DE",
    "created_at": "2027-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "communities": [
    {
      "name": "Official IC Community",
      "public_key": "ed25519:def456...",
      "joined_at": "2027-01-15",
      "rating": { "game_module": "ra1", "value": 1823, "rd": 45 },
      "matches_played": 342,
      "achievements": 23,
      "credentials": [
        {
          "type": "rating",
          "payload_hex": "...",
          "signature_hex": "...",
          "note": "Self-verifying — import on any IC install"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "friends": [
    { "display_name": "alice", "community": "Official IC Community", "added_at": "2027-02-01" }
  ],
  "statistics_summary": {
    "total_matches": 429,
    "total_playtime_hours": 412,
    "win_rate": 0.579,
    "faction_distribution": { "soviet": 0.67, "allied": 0.28, "random": 0.05 }
  },
  "saves_count": 12,
  "replays_count": 287,
  "screenshots_count": 45
}
```

The key feature: **SCRs are included in the export and are self-verifying.** A player can import their profile JSON on a new machine, and their ratings and achievements are cryptographically proven without contacting any server. No other game offers this.

### Platform Cloud Sync (Optional)

For players who use Steam, GOG Galaxy, or other platforms with cloud save support, IC can optionally sync critical data via the `PlatformServices` trait:

```rust
/// Extension to PlatformServices (D053) for cloud backup.
pub trait PlatformCloudSync {
    /// Upload a small file to platform cloud storage.
    fn cloud_save(&self, key: &str, data: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;
    /// Download a file from platform cloud storage.
    fn cloud_load(&self, key: &str) -> Result<Option<Vec<u8>>>;
    /// List available cloud files.
    fn cloud_list(&self) -> Result<Vec<CloudEntry>>;
    /// Available cloud storage quota (bytes).
    fn cloud_quota(&self) -> Result<CloudQuota>;
}

pub struct CloudQuota {
    pub used: u64,
    pub total: u64,  // e.g., Steam Cloud: ~1 GB per game
}
```

**What syncs:**

| Data                | Sync?   | Rationale                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `keys/identity.key` | **Yes** | Critical — also recoverable via mnemonic seed phrase, but cloud sync is simpler |
| `profile.db`        | **Yes** | Small, essential                                                                |
| `communities/*.db`  | **Yes** | Small, contains verified reputation (SCRs)                                      |
| `achievements.db`   | **Yes** | Small, contains achievement proofs                                              |
| `config.yaml`       | **Yes** | Small, preserves preferences across machines                                    |
| Latest autosave     | **Yes** | Resume campaign on another machine (one `.icsave` only)                         |
| `saves/*.icsave`    | No      | Too large for cloud quotas (user manages manually)                              |
| `replays/*.icrep`   | No      | Too large, not critical                                                         |
| `screenshots/*.png` | No      | Too large, not critical                                                         |
| `workshop/`         | No      | Re-downloadable                                                                 |

**Total cloud footprint:** ~5–20 MB. Well within Steam Cloud's ~1 GB per-game quota.

**Sync triggers:** Cloud sync happens at: game launch (download), game exit (upload), and after completing a match/mission (upload changed community DBs). Never during gameplay — no sync I/O on the hot path.

### Screenshots

Screenshots are standard PNG files with embedded metadata in the PNG `tEXt` chunks:

| Key                | Value                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `IC:EngineVersion` | `"0.5.0"`                                       |
| `IC:GameModule`    | `"ra1"`                                         |
| `IC:MapName`       | `"Arena"`                                       |
| `IC:Timestamp`     | `"2027-03-15T15:45:32Z"`                        |
| `IC:Players`       | `"CommanderZod (Soviet) vs alice (Allied)"`     |
| `IC:GameTick`      | `"18432"`                                       |
| `IC:ReplayFile`    | `"2027-03-15-ranked-1v1.icrep"` (if applicable) |

Standard PNG viewers ignore these chunks; IC's screenshot browser reads them for filtering and organization. The screenshot hotkey (mapped in `config.yaml`) captures the current frame, embeds metadata, and saves to `screenshots/` with a timestamped filename.

### Mnemonic Seed Recovery

The Ed25519 private key in `keys/identity.key` is the player's cryptographic identity. If lost without backup, ratings, achievements, and community memberships are gone. Cloud sync and auto-snapshots mitigate this, but both require the original machine to have been configured correctly. A player who never enabled cloud sync and whose hard drive dies loses everything.

**Mnemonic seed phrases** solve this with zero infrastructure. Inspired by BIP-39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39), the pattern derives a cryptographic keypair deterministically from a human-readable word sequence. The player writes the words on paper. On any machine, entering those words regenerates the identical keypair. The cheapest, most resilient "cloud backup" is a piece of paper in a drawer.

#### How It Works

1. **Key generation:** When IC creates a new identity, it generates 256 bits of entropy from the OS CSPRNG (`getrandom`).
2. **Mnemonic encoding:** The entropy maps to a 24-word phrase from the BIP-39 English wordlist (2048 words, 11 bits per word, 24 × 11 = 264 bits — 256 bits entropy + 8-bit checksum). The wordlist is curated for unambiguous reading: no similar-looking words, no offensive words, sorted alphabetically. Example: `abandon ability able about above absent absorb abstract absurd abuse access accident`.
3. **Key derivation:** The mnemonic phrase is run through PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (2048 rounds, per BIP-39 spec) with an optional passphrase as salt (default: empty string). The 512-bit output is truncated to 32 bytes and used as the Ed25519 private key seed.
4. **Deterministic output:** Same 24 words + same passphrase → identical Ed25519 keypair on any platform. The derivation uses only standardized primitives (PBKDF2, HMAC, SHA-512, Ed25519) — no IC-specific code in the critical path.

```rust
/// Derives an Ed25519 keypair from a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.
///
/// The derivation is deterministic: same words + same passphrase
/// always produce the same keypair on every platform.
pub fn keypair_from_mnemonic(
    words: &[&str; 24],
    passphrase: &str,
) -> Result<Ed25519Keypair, MnemonicError> {
    let entropy = mnemonic_to_entropy(words)?;  // validate checksum
    let salt = format!("mnemonic{}", passphrase);
    let mut seed = [0u8; 64];
    pbkdf2_hmac_sha512(
        &entropy_to_seed_input(words),
        salt.as_bytes(),
        2048,
        &mut seed,
    );
    let signing_key = Ed25519SigningKey::from_bytes(&seed[..32])?;
    Ok(Ed25519Keypair {
        signing_key,
        verifying_key: signing_key.verifying_key(),
    })
}
```

#### Optional Passphrase (Advanced)

The mnemonic can optionally be combined with a user-chosen passphrase during key derivation. This provides two-factor recovery: the 24 words (something you wrote down) + the passphrase (something you remember). Different passphrases produce different keypairs from the same words — useful for advanced users who want plausible deniability or multiple identities from one seed. The default is no passphrase (empty string). The UI does not promote this feature — it's accessible via CLI and the advanced section of the recovery flow.

#### CLI Commands

```
ic identity seed show          # Display the 24-word mnemonic for the current identity
                               # Requires interactive confirmation ("This is your recovery phrase.
                               # Anyone with these words can become you. Write them down and
                               # store them somewhere safe.")
ic identity seed verify        # Enter 24 words to verify they match the current identity
ic identity recover            # Enter 24 words (+ optional passphrase) to regenerate keypair
                               # If identity.key already exists, prompts for confirmation
                               # before overwriting
ic identity recover --passphrase  # Prompt for passphrase in addition to mnemonic
```

#### Security Properties

| **Brute-force resistance** | 2²⁵⁶ possible mnemonics. Infeasible to enumerate.                                                                                             |
| **Checksum**               | Last 8 bits are SHA-256 checksum of the entropy. Catches typos during recovery (1 word wrong → checksum fails).                               |
| **Offline**                | No network, no server, no cloud. The 24 words ARE the identity.                                                                               |
| **Standard**               | BIP-39 is used by every major cryptocurrency wallet. Millions of users have successfully recovered keys from mnemonic phrases. Battle-tested. |
| **Platform-independent**   | Same words produce the same key on Windows, macOS, Linux, WASM, mobile. The derivation uses only standardized cryptographic primitives.       |

#### What the Mnemonic Does NOT Replace

- **Cloud sync** — still the best option for seamless multi-device use. The mnemonic is the disaster recovery layer beneath cloud sync.
- **Regular backups** — the mnemonic recovers the *identity* (keypair). It does not recover save files, replays, screenshots, or settings. A full backup preserves everything.
- **Community server records** — after mnemonic recovery, the player's keypair is restored, but community servers still hold the match history and SCRs. No re-earning needed — the recovered keypair matches the old public key, so existing SCRs validate automatically.

#### Precedent

The BIP-39 mnemonic pattern has been used since 2013 by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and every major cryptocurrency wallet. Ledger, Trezor, MetaMask, and Phantom all use 24-word recovery phrases as the standard key backup mechanism. The pattern has survived a decade of adversarial conditions (billions of dollars at stake) and is understood by millions of non-technical users. IC adapts the encoding and derivation steps verbatim — the only IC-specific part is using the derived key for Ed25519 identity rather than cryptocurrency transactions.

### Player Experience

The mechanical design above (CLI, formats, directory layout) is the foundation. This section defines what the *player* actually sees and feels. The guiding principle: **players should never lose data without trying.** The system works in layers:

1. **Invisible layer (always-on):** Cloud sync for critical data, automatic daily snapshots
2. **Gentle nudge layer:** Milestone-based reminders, status indicators in settings
3. **Explicit action layer:** In-game Data & Backup panel, CLI for power users
4. **Emergency layer:** Disaster recovery, identity re-creation guidance

#### First Launch — New Player

Integrates with D032's "Day-one nostalgia choice." After the player picks their experience profile (Classic/Remastered/Modern), two additional steps:

**Step 1 — Identity creation + recovery phrase:**

**Step 2 — Cloud sync offer:**

```

│  You can always manage backups in Settings → Data & Backup  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rules:**
- Identity creation is automatic — no sign-up, no email, no password
- The recovery phrase is shown once during first launch, then always accessible via Settings or CLI
- Cloud sync is offered but not required — "Continue" without enabling works fine
- Skipping the recovery phrase is allowed (no forced engagement) — the first milestone nudge will remind
- If no platform cloud is available (non-Steam/non-GOG install), Step 2 instead shows: "We recommend creating a backup after your first few games. IC will remind you."
- The entire flow is skippable — no forced engagement

```

On successful recovery, the flow shows the restored identity (display name, public key fingerprint) and continues to the normal first-launch experience. Community servers recognize the recovered identity by its public key — existing SCRs validate automatically.

**Note:** Mnemonic recovery restores the *identity only* (keypair). Save files, replays, screenshots, and settings are not recovered by the phrase — those require a full backup or folder copy. The restore options panel makes this clear: "Recover from recovery phrase" is listed alongside "Restore from backup file" because they solve different problems. A player who has both a phrase and a backup should use the backup (it includes everything); a player who only has the phrase gets their identity back and can re-earn or re-download the rest.

```

Key UX detail: **SCRs are verified during restore and the player sees it.** The progress screen shows credentials being cryptographically validated. This is a trust-building moment — "your reputation is portable and provable" becomes tangible.

#### Automatic Behaviors (No Player Interaction Required)

Most players never open a settings screen for backup. These behaviors protect them silently:

**Auto cloud sync (if enabled):**
- **On game exit:** Upload changed `profile.db`, `communities/*.db`, `achievements.db`, `config.yaml`, `keys/identity.key`, latest autosave. Silent — no UI prompt.
- **On game launch:** Download cloud data, merge if needed (last-write-wins for simple files; SCR merge for community DBs — SCRs are append-only with timestamps, so merge is deterministic).
- **After completing a match:** Upload updated community DB (new match result / rating change). Background, non-blocking.

**Automatic daily snapshots (always-on, even without cloud):**
- On first launch of the day, the engine writes a lightweight "critical data snapshot" to `<data_dir>/backups/auto-critical-N.zip` containing only `keys/`, `profile.db`, `communities/*.db`, `achievements.db`, `config.yaml` (~5 MB total).
- Rotating 3-day retention: `auto-critical-1.zip`, `auto-critical-2.zip`, `auto-critical-3.zip`. Oldest overwritten.
- No user interaction, no prompt, no notification. Background I/O during asset loading — invisible.
- Even players who never touch backup settings have 3 rolling days of critical data protection.

**Post-milestone nudges (main menu toasts):**

After significant events, a non-intrusive toast appears on the main menu — same system as D030's Workshop cleanup toasts:

| Trigger                                | Toast (cloud sync active)                                                    | Toast (no cloud sync)                                                                                    |

| First ranked match                     | `Your competitive career has begun! Your rating is backed up automatically.` | `Your competitive career has begun! Protect your rating: [Back up now]  [Dismiss]`                       |
| First campaign mission                 | `Campaign progress saved.` (no toast — autosave handles it)                  | `Campaign progress saved. [Create backup]  [Dismiss]`                                                    |
| New ranked tier reached                | `Congratulations — Private First Class!`                                     | `Congratulations — Private First Class! [Back up now]  [Dismiss]`                                        |
| 30 days without full backup (no cloud) | —                                                                            | `It's been a month since your last backup. Your data folder is 1.4 GB. [Back up now]  [Remind me later]` |

**Nudge rules:**
- **Never during gameplay.** Only on main menu or post-game screen.
- **Maximum one nudge per session.** If multiple triggers fire, highest-priority wins.
- **Dismissable and respectful.** "Remind me later" delays by 7 days. Three consecutive dismissals for the same nudge type = never show that nudge again.
- **No nudges if cloud sync is active and healthy.** The player is already protected.
- **No nudges for the first 3 game sessions.** Let players enjoy the game before talking about data management.

#### Settings → Data & Backup Panel

In-game UI for players who want to manage their data visually. Accessible from Main Menu → Settings → Data & Backup. This is the GUI equivalent of the `ic backup` CLI — same operations, visual interface.

**When cloud sync is not available** (non-Steam/non-GOG install), the Cloud Sync section shows:

```

```

The ⚠ indicator is yellow, not red — it's a recommendation, not an error. "Local only" is a valid state, not a broken state.

**"Create full backup" flow:** Clicking the button opens a save-file dialog (pre-filled with `ic-backup-<date>.zip`). A progress bar shows backup creation. On completion: `Backup created: ic-backup-2027-03-15.zip (1.2 GB)` with [Open folder] button. The same categories as `ic backup create --exclude` are exposed via checkboxes in an "Advanced" expander (collapsed by default).

**"Restore from backup" flow:** Opens a file browser filtered to `.zip` files. After selection, shows the restore progress screen (see "First Launch — Existing Player" above). If existing data conflicts with backup data, prompts: `Your current data differs from the backup. [Overwrite with backup]  [Cancel]`.

#### Screenshot Gallery

The screenshot browser (Phase 3) uses PNG `tEXt` metadata to organize screenshots into a browsable gallery. Accessible from Main Menu → Screenshots:

Key feature: **"Watch replay" links directly to the replay file** via the `IC:ReplayFile` metadata. Screenshots become bookmarks into match history. A screenshot gallery doubles as a game history browser.

Filters use metadata: map name, game module, date, player names. Sorting by date (default), map, or file size.

#### Identity Loss — Disaster Recovery

If a player loses their machine with no backup and no cloud sync, the outcome depends on whether they saved their recovery phrase:

**Recoverable via mnemonic seed phrase:**
- Ed25519 private key (the identity itself) — enter 24 words on any machine to regenerate the identical keypair
- Community recognition — recovered key matches the old public key, so existing SCRs validate automatically
- Ratings and match history — community servers recognize the recovered identity without admin intervention

**Not recoverable via mnemonic (requires backup or re-creation):**
- Campaign save files, replay files, screenshots
- Local settings and preferences
- Achievement proofs signed by the old key (can be re-earned; or restored from backup if available)

**Re-downloadable:**
- Workshop content (mods, maps, resource packs)

**Partially recoverable via community (if mnemonic was also lost):**
- **Ratings and match history.** Community servers retain match records. A player creates a new identity, and a community admin can associate the new identity with the old record via a verified identity transfer (community-specific policy, not IC-mandated). The old SCRs prove the old identity held those ratings.
- **Friends.** Friends with the player in their list can re-add the new identity.

**Recovery hierarchy (best to worst):**
1. **Full backup** — everything restored, including saves, replays, screenshots
2. **Cloud sync** — identity, profile, ratings, settings, latest autosave restored
3. **Mnemonic seed phrase** — identity restored; saves, replays, settings lost
4. **Nothing saved** — fresh identity; community admin can transfer old records

**UX for total loss (no phrase, no backup, no cloud):** No special "recovery wizard." The player creates a fresh identity. The first-launch flow on the new identity presents the recovery phrase prominently. The system prevents the same mistake twice.

#### Console Commands (D058)

All Data & Backup panel operations have console equivalents:

| Command                     | Effect                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/backup create`            | Create full backup (interactive — shows progress)            |
| `/backup create --critical` | Create critical-only backup                                  |
| `/backup restore <path>`    | Restore from backup file                                     |
| `/backup list`              | List saved backups                                           |
| `/backup verify <path>`     | Verify archive integrity                                     |
| `/profile export`           | Export profile to JSON                                       |
| `/identity seed show`       | Display 24-word recovery phrase (requires confirmation)      |
| `/identity seed verify`     | Enter 24 words to verify they match current identity         |
| `/identity recover`         | Enter 24 words to regenerate keypair (overwrites if exists)  |
| `/data health`              | Show data health summary (identity, sync status, backup age) |
| `/data folder`              | Open data folder in system file manager                      |
| `/cloud sync`               | Trigger immediate cloud sync                                 |
| `/cloud status`             | Show cloud sync status and quota                             |

### Alternatives Considered

- **Proprietary backup format with encryption** (rejected — contradicts "standard formats only" principle; a ZIP file can be encrypted separately with standard tools if the player wants encryption)
- **IC-hosted cloud backup service** (rejected — creates infrastructure liability, ongoing cost, and makes player data dependent on IC's servers surviving; violates local-first philosophy)
- **Database-level replication** (rejected — over-engineered for the use case; SQLite `VACUUM INTO` is simpler, safer, and produces a self-contained file)
- **Steam Cloud as primary backup** (rejected — platform-specific, limited quota, opaque sync behavior; IC supports it as an *option*, not a requirement)
- **Incremental backup** (deferred — full backup via `VACUUM INTO` is sufficient for player-scale data; incremental adds complexity with minimal benefit unless someone has 50+ GB of replays)
- **Forced backup before first ranked match** (rejected — punishes players to solve a problem most won't have; auto-snapshots protect critical data without friction)
- **Scary "BACK UP YOUR KEY OR ELSE" warnings** (rejected — fear-based UX is hostile; the recovery phrase provides a genuine safety net, making fear unnecessary; factual presentation of options replaces warnings)
- **12-word mnemonic phrase** (rejected — 12 words = 128 bits of entropy; sufficient for most uses but 24 words = 256 bits matches Ed25519's full key strength; the BIP-39 ecosystem standardized on 24 words for high-security applications; the marginal cost of 12 extra words is negligible for a one-time operation)
- **Custom IC wordlist** (rejected — BIP-39's English wordlist is battle-tested, curated for unambiguous reading, and familiar to millions of cryptocurrency users; a custom list would need the same curation effort with no benefit)

### Integration with Existing Decisions

- **D010 (Snapshottable Sim):** Save files are sim snapshots — the backup system treats them as opaque binary files. No special handling needed beyond file copy.
- **D020 (Mod SDK & CLI):** The `ic backup` and `ic profile export` commands join the `ic` CLI family alongside `ic mod`, `ic replay`, `ic campaign`.
- **D030 (Workshop):** Post-milestone nudge toasts use the same toast system as Workshop cleanup prompts — consistent notification UX.
- **D032 (UI Themes):** First-launch identity creation integrates as the final step after theme selection. The Data & Backup panel is theme-aware.
- **D034 (SQLite):** SQLite is the backbone of player data storage. `VACUUM INTO` is the safe backup primitive — it handles WAL mode correctly and produces a compacted single-file copy.
- **D052 (Community Servers & SCR):** SCRs are the portable reputation unit. The backup system preserves them; the export system includes them. Because SCRs are cryptographically signed, they're self-verifying on import — no server round-trip needed. Restore progress screen visibly verifies SCRs.
- **D053 (Player Profile):** The profile export is D053's data portability implementation. All locally-authoritative profile fields export to JSON; all SCR-backed fields export with full credential data.
- **D036 (Achievements):** Achievement proofs are SCRs stored in `achievements.db`. Backup preserves them; export includes them in the JSON.
- **D058 (Console):** All backup/export operations have `/backup` and `/profile` console command equivalents.

### Phase

- **Phase 0:** Define and document the `<data_dir>` directory layout (this decision). Add `IC_DATA_DIR` / `--data-dir` override support.
- **Phase 2:** `ic backup create/restore` CLI ships alongside the save/load system. Screenshot capture with PNG metadata. Automatic daily critical snapshots (3-day rotating `auto-critical-N.zip`). Mnemonic seed generation integrated into identity creation — `ic identity seed show`, `ic identity seed verify`, `ic identity recover` CLI commands.
- **Phase 3:** Screenshot browser UI with metadata filtering and replay linking. Data & Backup settings panel (including "View recovery phrase" button). Post-milestone nudge toasts (first nudge reminds about recovery phrase if not yet confirmed). First-launch identity creation with recovery phrase display + cloud sync offer. Mnemonic recovery option in first-launch restore flow.
- **Phase 5:** `ic profile export` ships alongside multiplayer launch (GDPR compliance). Platform cloud sync via `PlatformServices` trait (Steam Cloud, GOG Galaxy). `ic backup verify` for archive integrity checking. First-launch restore flow (cloud detection + manual restore + mnemonic recovery). Console commands (`/backup`, `/profile`, `/identity`, `/data`, `/cloud`).


## D062: Mod Profiles & Virtual Asset Namespace

**Decision:** Introduce a layered asset composition model inspired by LVM's mark → pool → present pattern. Two new first-class concepts: **mod profiles** (named, hashable, switchable mod compositions) and a **virtual asset namespace** (a resolved lookup table mapping logical asset paths to content-addressed blobs).

**Core insight:** IC's three-phase data loading (D003, Factorio-inspired), dependency-graph ordering, and modpack manifests (D030) already describe a composition — but the composed result is computed on-the-fly at load time and dissolved into merged state. There's no intermediate object that represents "these N sources in this priority order with these conflict resolutions" as something you can name, hash, inspect, diff, save, or share independently. Making the composition explicit unlocks capabilities that the implicit version can't provide.

### The Three-Layer Model

The model separates mod loading into three explicit phases, inspired by LVM's physical volumes → volume groups → logical volumes:

| Layer              | LVM Analog      | IC Concept                       | What It Is                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source** (PV)    | Physical Volume | Registered mod/package/base game | A validated, installed content source — its files exist, its manifest is parsed, its dependencies are resolved. Immutable once registered.                                               |
| **Profile** (VG)   | Volume Group    | Mod profile                      | A named composition: which sources, in what priority order, with what conflict resolutions and experience settings. Saved as a YAML file. Hashable.                                      |
| **Namespace** (LV) | Logical Volume  | Virtual asset namespace          | The resolved lookup table: for every logical asset path, which blob (from which source) answers the query. Built from a profile at activation time. What the engine actually loads from. |

**The model does NOT replace three-phase data loading.** Three-phase loading (Define → Modify → Final-fixes) organizes *when* modifications apply during profile activation. The profile organizes *which* sources participate. They're orthogonal — the profile says "use mods A, B, C in this order" and three-phase loading says "first all Define phases, then all Modify phases, then all Final-fixes phases."

### Mod Profiles

A mod profile is a YAML file in the player's configuration directory that captures a complete, reproducible mod setup:

```yaml
# <data_dir>/profiles/tournament-s5.yaml
profile:
  name: "Tournament Season 5"
  game_module: ra1

# Which mods participate, in priority order (later overrides earlier)
sources:
  # Engine defaults and base game assets are always implicitly first
  - id: "official/tournament-balance"
    version: "=1.3.0"
  - id: "official/hd-sprites"
    version: "=2.0.1"
  - id: "community/improved-explosions"
    version: "^1.0.0"

# Explicit conflict resolutions (same role as conflicts.yaml, but profile-scoped)
conflicts:
  - unit: heavy_tank
    field: health.max
    use_source: "official/tournament-balance"

# Experience profile axes (D033) — bundled with the mod set
experience:
  balance: classic           # D019
  theme: remastered          # D032
  behavior: iron_curtain     # D033
  ai_behavior: enhanced      # D043
  pathfinding: ic_default    # D045
  render_mode: hd_sprites    # D048

# Computed at activation time, not authored
fingerprint: null  # sha256 of the resolved namespace — set by engine
```

**Relationship to existing concepts:**

- **Experience profiles (D033)** set 6 switchable axes (balance, theme, behavior, AI, pathfinding, render mode) but don't specify *which community mods* are active. A mod profile bundles experience settings WITH the mod set — one object captures the full player experience.
- **Modpacks (D030)** are published, versioned Workshop resources. A mod profile is a local, personal composition. **Publishing a mod profile creates a modpack** — `ic mod publish-profile` snapshots the profile into a `mod.yaml` modpack manifest for Workshop distribution. This makes mod profiles the local precursor to modpacks: curators build and test profiles locally, then publish the working result.
- **`conflicts.yaml` (existing)** is a global conflict override file. Profile-scoped conflicts apply only when that profile is active. Both mechanisms coexist — profile conflicts take precedence, then global `conflicts.yaml`, then default last-wins behavior.

**Profile operations:**

```bash
# Create a profile from the currently active mod set
ic profile save "tournament-s5"

# List saved profiles
ic profile list

# Activate a profile (loads its mods + experience settings)
ic profile activate "tournament-s5"

# Show what a profile resolves to (namespace preview + conflict report)
ic profile inspect "tournament-s5"

# Diff two profiles — which assets differ, which conflicts resolve differently
ic profile diff "tournament-s5" "casual-hd"

# Publish as a modpack to Workshop
ic mod publish-profile "tournament-s5"

# Import a Workshop modpack as a local profile
ic profile import "alice/red-apocalypse-pack"
```

**In-game UX:** The mod manager gains a profile dropdown (top of the mod list). Switching profiles reconfigures the active mod set and experience settings in one action. In multiplayer lobbies, the host's profile fingerprint is displayed — joining players with the same fingerprint skip per-mod verification. Players with a different configuration see a diff view: "You're missing mod X" or "You have mod Y v2.0, lobby has v2.1" with one-click resolution (download missing, update mismatched).

### Virtual Asset Namespace

When a profile is activated, the engine builds a **virtual asset namespace** — a complete lookup table mapping every logical asset path to a specific content-addressed blob from a specific source. This is functionally an OverlayFS union view over the content-addressed store (D049 local CAS).

```

  effects/explosion_large.yaml  → blob:f2c8d3... (source: community/improved-explosions)
```

**Key properties:**

- **Deterministic:** Same profile + same source versions = identical namespace. The fingerprint (SHA-256 of the sorted namespace entries) proves it.
- **Inspectable:** `ic profile inspect` dumps the full namespace with provenance — which source provided which asset. Invaluable for debugging "why does my tank look wrong?" (answer: mod X overrode the sprite at priority 3).
- **Diffable:** `ic profile diff` compares two namespaces entry-by-entry — shows exact asset-level differences between two mod configurations. Critical for modpack curators testing variations.
- **Cacheable:** The namespace is computed once at profile activation and persisted as a lightweight index. Asset loads during gameplay are simple hash lookups — no per-load directory scanning or priority resolution.

**Integration with Bevy's asset system:** The virtual namespace registers as a custom Bevy `AssetSource` that resolves asset paths through the namespace lookup table rather than filesystem directory traversal. When Bevy requests `sprites/rifle_infantry.shp`, the namespace resolves it to `workshop/blobs/a7/a7f3e2...` (the CAS blob path). This sits between IC's mod resolution layer and Bevy's asset loading — Bevy sees a flat namespace, unaware of the layering beneath.

```rust
/// A resolved mapping from logical asset path to content-addressed blob.
pub struct VirtualNamespace {
    /// Logical path → (blob hash, source that provided it)
    entries: HashMap<AssetPath, NamespaceEntry>,
    /// SHA-256 of the sorted entries — the profile fingerprint
    fingerprint: [u8; 32],
}

pub struct NamespaceEntry {
    pub blob_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub source_id: ModId,
    pub source_version: Version,
    /// How this entry won: default, last-wins, explicit-conflict-resolution
    pub resolution: ResolutionReason,
}

pub enum ResolutionReason {
    /// Only one source provides this path — no conflict
    Unique,
    /// Multiple sources; this one won via load-order priority (last-wins)
    LastWins { overridden: Vec<ModId> },
    /// Explicit resolution from profile conflicts or conflicts.yaml
    ExplicitOverride { reason: String },
    /// Engine default (no mod provides this path)
    EngineDefault,
}
```

### Namespace for YAML Rules (Not Just File Assets)

The virtual namespace covers two distinct layers:

1. **File assets** — sprites, audio, models, textures. Resolved by path → blob hash. Simple overlay; last-wins per path.

2. **YAML rule state** — the merged game data after three-phase loading. This is NOT a simple file overlay — it's the result of Define → Modify → Final-fixes across all active mods. The namespace captures the *output* of this merge as a serialized snapshot. This snapshot IS the fingerprint's primary input — two players with identical fingerprints have identical merged rule state, guaranteed.

The YAML rule merge runs during profile activation (not per-load). The merged result is cached. If no mods change, the cache is valid. This is the same work the engine already does — the namespace just makes the result explicit and hashable.

### Multiplayer Integration

**Lobby fingerprint verification:** When a player joins a lobby, the client sends its active profile fingerprint. If it matches the host's fingerprint, the player is guaranteed to have identical game data — no per-mod version checking needed. If fingerprints differ, the lobby computes a namespace diff and presents actionable resolution:

- **Missing mods:** "Download mod X?" (triggers D030 auto-download)
- **Version mismatch:** "Update mod Y from v2.0 to v2.1?" (one-click update)
- **Conflict resolution difference:** "Host resolves heavy_tank.health.max from mod A; you resolve from mod B" — player can accept host's profile or leave

This replaces the current per-mod version list comparison with a single hash comparison (fast path) and falls back to detailed diff only on mismatch. The diff view is more informative than the current "incompatible mods" rejection.

**Replay recording:** Replays record the profile fingerprint alongside the existing `(mod_id, version)` list. Playback verifies the fingerprint. A fingerprint mismatch warns but doesn't block playback — the existing mod list provides degraded compatibility checking.

### Editor Integration (D038)

The scenario editor benefits from profile-aware asset resolution:

- **Layer isolation:** The editor can show "assets from mod X" vs "assets from engine defaults" in separate layer views — same UX pattern as the editor's own entity layers with lock/visibility.
- **Hot-swap a single source:** When editing a mod's YAML rules, the editor rebuilds only that source's contribution to the namespace rather than re-running the full three-phase merge across all N sources. This enables sub-second iteration for rule authoring.
- **Source provenance in tooltips:** Hovering over a unit in the editor shows "defined in engine-defaults, modified by official/tournament-balance" — derived directly from namespace entry provenance.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Just use modpacks (D030)** — Modpacks are the published form; profiles are the local form. Without profiles, curators manually reconstruct their mod configuration every session. Profiles make the curator workflow reproducible.
- **Bevy AssetSources alone** — Bevy's `AssetSource` API can layer directories, but it doesn't provide conflict detection, provenance tracking, fingerprinting, or diffing. The namespace sits above Bevy's loader, not instead of it.
- **Full OverlayFS on the filesystem** — Overkill. The namespace is an in-memory lookup table, not a filesystem driver. We get the same logical result without OS-level complexity or platform dependencies.
- **Hash per-mod rather than hash the composed namespace** — Per-mod hashes miss the composition: same mods + different conflict resolutions = different gameplay. The namespace fingerprint captures the actual resolved state.
- **Make profiles mandatory** — Rejected. A player who installs one mod and clicks play shouldn't need to understand profiles. The engine creates a default implicit profile from the active mod set. Profiles become relevant when players want multiple configurations or when modpack curators need reproducibility.

### Integration with Existing Decisions

- **D003 (Real YAML):** YAML rule merge during profile activation uses the same `serde_yaml` pipeline. The namespace captures the merge result, not the raw files.
- **D019 (Balance Presets):** Balance preset selection is a field in the mod profile. Switching profiles can switch the balance preset simultaneously.
- **D030 (Workshop):** Modpacks are published snapshots of mod profiles. `ic mod publish-profile` bridges local profiles to Workshop distribution. Workshop modpacks import as local profiles via `ic profile import`.
- **D033 (Experience Profiles):** Experience profile axes (balance, theme, behavior, AI, pathfinding, render mode) are embedded in mod profiles. A mod profile is a superset: experience settings + mod set + conflict resolutions.
- **D034 (SQLite):** The namespace index is optionally cached in SQLite for fast profile switching. Profile metadata (name, fingerprint, last-activated) is stored alongside other player preferences.
- **D038 (Scenario Editor):** Editor uses namespace provenance for source attribution and per-layer hot-swap during development.
- **D049 (Workshop Asset Formats & P2P / CAS):** The virtual namespace maps logical paths to content-addressed blobs in the local CAS store. The namespace IS the virtualization layer that makes CAS usable for gameplay asset loading.
- **D058 (Console):** `/profile list`, `/profile activate <name>`, `/profile inspect`, `/profile diff <a> <b>`, `/profile save <name>` console commands.

### Phase

- **Phase 2:** Implicit default profile — the engine internally constructs a namespace from the active mod set at load time. No user-facing profile concept yet, but the `VirtualNamespace` struct exists and is used for asset resolution. Fingerprint is computed and recorded in replays.
- **Phase 4:** `ic profile save/list/activate/inspect/diff` CLI commands. Profile YAML schema stabilized. Modpack curators can save and switch profiles during testing.
- **Phase 5:** Lobby fingerprint verification replaces per-mod version list comparison. Namespace diff view in lobby UI. `/profile` console commands. Replay fingerprint verification on playback.
- **Phase 6a:** `ic mod publish-profile` publishes a local profile as a Workshop modpack. `ic profile import` imports modpacks as local profiles. In-game mod manager gains profile dropdown. Editor provenance tooltips and per-source hot-swap.

## D005: Modding — WASM for Power Users (Tier 3)

**Decision:** WASM modules via `wasmtime`/`wasmer` for advanced mods.

**Rationale:**
- Near-native performance
- Perfectly sandboxed by design
- Deterministic execution (critical for multiplayer)
- Modders can write in Rust, C, Go, AssemblyScript, or Python-to-WASM
- Leapfrogs OpenRA (requires C# for deep mods)

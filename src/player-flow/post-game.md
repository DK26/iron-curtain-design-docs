**Post-game elements:**

- **Stats comparison** — Economy, production, combat, activity (APM/EPM). Graphs available on hover/click.
- **MVP Awards** — Stat-based recognition cards highlighting top performers (see MVP Awards section below).
- **Rating update** — Tier badge animation if promoted/demoted. Delta shown.
- **Chat** — Active for the full 5-minute post-game lobby duration. Both teams can talk.
- **Post-game learning** (D065) — Rule-based tip analyzing the match (e.g., idle harvesters, low APM, no control groups used). Links to tutorial or replay annotation.
- **Watch Replay** → Replay Viewer (immediate — the `.icrep` file is incrementally valid during recording, so the viewer can open it before the writer finalizes the archival header)
- **Save Replay** → Save finalized `.icrep` file with complete header (`total_ticks`, `final_state_hash`) and metadata (available after the background writer flushes on match end)
- **Re-Queue** → Back to matchmaking queue (ranked)
- **Main Menu** → Return to main menu
- **Report Player** → Report dialog (reason dropdown, optional text)
- **Post-play feedback pulse** (optional, sampled) — quick "how was this?" prompt for mode/mod/campaign with skip/snooze controls

#### MVP Awards (Post-Game Recognition)

After every multiplayer match (skirmish, ranked, co-op, team), the post-game screen will display stat-based MVP award cards recognizing standout performance. These are auto-calculated from match data — no player voting required.

**Award categories** — the engine selects 2–4 awards per match from the following categories, based on which stats are most exceptional relative to the match context. Not all awards appear every game — only standout performances are highlighted.

**Award selection algorithm:**

1. After match ends, compute all stat categories for all players
2. For each category, check if any player's stat is significantly above the match average (threshold: top percentile relative to match context, not absolute values)
3. Select the top 2–4 most exceptional awards — prefer variety across categories (don't show 3 combat awards)
4. In 1v1: show 1–2 awards per player. In team games: show 3–4 total across all players. Overall MVP always shown if the match has 3+ players
5. Each player also sees a **personal award** (their single best stat) even if they didn't earn a match-wide award

**Design rules:**

- **No effect on ranked rating.** Awards are cosmetic recognition only — Glicko-2 rating changes are computed purely from win/loss (D055).
- **Profile-visible.** Award counts are tracked in the player profile (D053) — e.g., "MVP ×47, Tycoon ×23, Iron Wall ×15." Displayed as a stat line, not badges.
- **Moddable.** Award definitions are YAML-driven (`awards.yaml`): name, icon, stat formula, threshold, flavor text. Modders can add game-module-specific awards (e.g., Tiberian Dawn: "Nod Commander" for most stealth unit kills). Workshop-publishable.
- **Anti-farming.** Awards are only granted in matches that meet minimum thresholds: minimum match duration (>3 minutes), minimum opponent count/difficulty, and no early surrenders. AI-only matches grant awards but they are tagged as `vs-AI` in the profile and tracked separately.
- **Replay-linked.** Each award links to the replay moment that earned it (e.g., "Decimator" links to the tick of the largest battle). Clicking the award in the post-game screen jumps to that moment in the replay viewer.

#### Play-of-the-Game (D077)

After each match, the highest-scoring highlight moment is displayed as a **POTG viewport** on the post-game screen — a 20–45 second replay clip with cinematic camera and a category label (e.g., "Decisive Assault", "Against All Odds", "Nuclear Option"). All players in multiplayer see the same POTG (deterministic scoring from the shared Analysis Event Stream).

- **Skippable** — Escape or Skip button jumps to MVP awards / stats screen
- **Team games:** Bonus for coordinated team actions in the same engagement window
- **Scoring:** Four-dimension pipeline (engagement density 0.35, momentum swing 0.25, z-score anomaly 0.20, rarity bonus 0.20) with per-match baselines. See `decisions/09d/D077-replay-highlights.md` for the full scoring specification
- **Category labels:** YAML-moddable per game module (`highlight-config.yaml`)
- **Highlight library:** Top 5 moments per match stored as replay references in SQLite (`profile.db`); available in Profile → Highlights and as a main menu background option

#### Post-Play Feedback Prompt (Modes / Mods / Campaigns; Optional D049 + D053)

The post-game screen may show a **sampled, skippable** feedback prompt. It is designed to help mode/mod/campaign authors improve content without blocking normal post-game actions.

**UX rules:**
- sampled/cooldown-based, not every match/session
- non-blocking: replay/save/requeue/main-menu actions remain available
- clearly labeled target (`mode`, `campaign`, `Workshop resource`)
- spoiler-safe defaults for campaign feedback prompts
- "helpful review" recognition wording is explicit about **profile-only** rewards

#### Report / Block / Avoid Player Dialog (D059 + D052 + D055)

The `Report Player` action (also available from lobby/player-list context menus) opens a compact moderation dialog with local safety controls and queue preferences in the same place, but with clear scope labels.

```

**UX rules:**
- `Avoid Player` is labeled **best-effort** and links to ranked queue constraints (D055)
- `Mute`/`Block` remain usable without submitting a report
- Evidence is attached by reference/ID when possible (no unnecessary duplicate upload). The reporter does **not** see raw relay telemetry — only the moderation backend and reviewers with appropriate privileges access telemetry summaries.
- The dialog is available post-game, from scoreboard/player list, and from lobby profile/context menus

#### Community Review Queue (Optional D052 "Overwatch"-Style, Reviewer/Moderator Surface)

Eligible community reviewers (or moderators) may access an optional review queue if the community server enables D052's review capability. This is a **separate role surface** from normal player matchmaking UX.

**Reviewer UI rules (D052/D037/`06-SECURITY`):**
- anonymized subject identity by default; identity resolution requires moderator privileges
- no direct "ban player" buttons in reviewer UI
- case verdicts feed consensus/moderator workflows; they do not apply irreversible sanctions directly
- calibration and reviewer-weight details are visible to the reviewer for transparency, but not editable
- audit logging records case assignment, replay access, and vote submission events

#### Moderator Case Resolution (Optional D052)

Moderator tools extend the reviewer surface with:
- identity resolution (subject + reporters) when needed
- consensus summary + reviewer agreement breakdown
- prior sanctions / community standing context
- action panel (warn, comms restriction, queue cooldown, low-priority queue, ranked suspension)
- appeal state management and case notes

This keeps the "Overwatch"-style layer useful for scaling review while preserving D037 moderator accountability for final enforcement.

#### Asymmetric Co-op Post-Game Breakdown (D070)

D070 matches add a role-aware breakdown tab/card to the post-game screen:

- **Commander support efficiency**
  - requests answered / denied / timed out
  - average request response time
  - support impact events (e.g., CAS confirmed kills, successful extraction)
- **SpecOps objective execution**
  - field objectives completed
  - infiltration/sabotage/rescue success rate
  - squad survival / losses / requisition spend
- **War-effort impact categories**
  - economy gains/denials
  - power/tech disruptions
  - route/bridge/expansion unlock events
  - superweapon delay / denial events
- **Joint coordination highlights** (optional)
  - moments where Field Ops objective completion unlocked a commander push (segment unlock, AA disable, radar outage)

This reinforces the mode's cooperative identity and provides actionable learning without forcing competitive scoring semantics onto a PvE-first mode.

#### Experimental Survival Post-Game Breakdown (D070-adjacent `Last Commando Standing` / `SpecOps Survival`) — Proposal-Only

D070-adjacent survival matches (proposal-only, `M10+`, `P-Optional`) add a placement- and objective-focused breakdown so players understand **why** they survived (or were eliminated), not just who got the last hit.

**Survival breakdown focus (prototype-first):**
- **Placement + elimination context** (where/how the run ended)
- **Objective contesting and reward impact** (what captures actually changed)
- **Hazard pressure stats** (escapes, hazard-phase survival, hazard-caused vs combat-caused losses)
- **Squad/redeploy usage** (downs, revives/redeploys, token efficiency)
- **Field progression spend** (what upgrades/support buys were used)

This keeps the D070-adjacent survival mode readable and learnable without forcing a generic battle-royale scoreboard style onto an RTS-flavored commando mode.

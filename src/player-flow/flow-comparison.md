## Flow Comparison: Classic RA vs. Iron Curtain

For returning players, here's how IC's flow maps to what they remember:

| Classic RA (1996)                    | Iron Curtain                                   | Notes                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title screen → Main Menu             | Shellmap → Main Menu                           | IC adds live battle behind menu (Remastered style)            |
| New Game → Allied/Soviet             | Campaign → Allied/Soviet                       | Same fork. IC adds branching graph, roster persistence.       |
| Mission Briefing → Loading → Mission | Briefing → (seamless load) → Mission           | IC eliminates loading screen between missions where possible. |
| Exit to menu between missions        | Continuous flow                                | Debrief → briefing → next mission, no menu exit.              |
| Skirmish → Map select → Play         | Skirmish → Map/Players/Settings → Play         | Same structure, more options.                                 |
| Modem/Serial/IPX → Lobby             | Multiplayer Hub → 5 connection methods → Lobby | Far more connectivity options. Same lobby concept.            |
| Options → Video/Sound/Controls       | Settings → 7 tabs                              | Same categories, much deeper customization.                   |
| —                                    | Workshop                                       | New: browse and install community content.                    |

| —                                    | Replays                                        | New: watch saved games.                                       |
| —                                    | Encyclopedia                                   | New: in-game unit reference.                                  |
| —                                    | SDK (separate app)                             | New: visual scenario and asset editing.                       |

The core flow is preserved: **Menu → Pick mode → Configure → Play → Results → Menu.** IC adds depth at every step without changing the fundamental rhythm.

#### Filter System

Seven filter dimensions (adapted from OpenRA's proven model, extended with IC-specific fields):

| Filter | Options | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Scope** | My Games / Bookmarked / All Local / Imported | Default: My Games |
| **Game Type** | Any / Ranked / Custom / Campaign / Skirmish vs AI | |
| **Date Range** | Today / This Week / This Month / This Year / All Time | |
| **Duration** | Any / Short (<10 min) / Medium (10–30 min) / Long (30–60 min) / Epic (60+ min) | |
| **Map** | Dropdown populated from local replay metadata | Searchable |
| **Player** | Text field with autocomplete from local replay metadata | |
| **Outcome** | Any / Victory / Defeat / Draw | Relative to the selected player filter |

- Sort by: Date (default), Duration, Map Name, Player Count, Rating Change
- Filters are additive (AND logic); [Reset Filters] clears all
- Replay list loads asynchronously — no UI freeze on large collections

#### Replay Detail Panel (Right Side)

- **Map preview:** Minimap render with spawn point markers per player (colored dots)
- **Player list:** Name, faction, team, outcome (Win/Loss/Draw), APM average
- **Metadata:** Duration, balance preset, game speed, mod fingerprint, signed/unsigned status, engine version
- **Missing map handling:** If the replay's map is not installed, show [Install Map →] inline (downloads from Workshop if available) — adapted from OpenRA's auto-install pattern
- **Foreign replay badge:** Imported replays show source format badge (OpenRA / Remastered) and divergence confidence level (D056)

#### Actions

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **[Watch]** | Launch Replay Viewer |
| **[Share]** | Copy Match ID to clipboard, or export `.icrep` file |
| **[Rename]** | Rename the replay file |
| **[Delete]** | Delete with confirmation |
| **[Import Replay...]** | File browser for `.icrep`, `.orarep`, Remastered replays (D056) |
| **[Enter Match ID...]** | Download a relay-hosted replay by match ID (see Sharing section below) |

### Replay Viewer

```
Replay Browser → [Watch]
  — or —
Post-Game → [Watch Replay]
  — or —
Match History → [Watch]
  — or —
Double-click .icrep file (OS file association)
```

The Replay Viewer reuses the full game viewport with an observer transport bar replacing the player HUD. The right sidebar shows the minimap and observer panels.

### Transport Controls

#### Button Bar

| Button | Icon | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Jump to Start** | ⏮ | Jump to tick 0 |
| **Rewind 15s** | ◄◄ | Jump back 15 seconds (configurable: 5s/10s/15s/30s) |
| **Step Back** | ◄ | Step back one game tick (hold for slow reverse scan) |
| **Play / Pause** | ▶/⏸ | Toggle playback |
| **Step Forward** | ► | Step forward one game tick (hold for slow forward scan) |
| **Fast Forward 15s** | ►► | Jump forward 15 seconds |
| **Jump to End** | ⏭ | Jump to final tick |

#### Speed Controls

Speed buttons are displayed as discrete clickable labels (not a dropdown — LoL's single-click model, avoiding Dota 2's dropdown regression):

```
0.25x  0.5x  [1x]  2x  4x  8x  Max
```

The active speed is highlighted. Click to switch instantly.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `B` | Rewind 15 seconds (SC2 convention) |
| `N` | Fast forward 15 seconds |
| `,` (comma) | Step back one tick |
| `.` (period) | Step forward one tick |
| `[` | Decrease speed one tier |
| `]` | Increase speed one tier |
| `Home` | Jump to start |
| `End` | Jump to end |
| `Ctrl+B` | Add bookmark at current tick |
| `←` / `→` | Jump to previous / next bookmark or event marker |
| `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` | Jump to previous / next engagement |
| `Escape` | Open replay menu (exit / settings / summary) |

#### Seeking

IC's 300-tick (~10 second) keyframe snapshots enable **true arbitrary seeking** — the key architectural advantage over OpenRA, AoE2, CoH3, and WC3 (all forward-only).

- **Click anywhere on the timeline** to jump to that moment
- **Drag the playhead** to scrub through the replay
- Re-simulation from nearest keyframe takes <100ms for typical games
- Both forward and backward seeking are supported
- Seeking works at any point — no "already viewed" restriction (unlike SC2)

---

### Timeline / Scrub Bar

The timeline is the most important UX element in the replay viewer. IC's design draws from LoL's annotated timeline (the strongest surveyed) while adding spoiler-free mode (an unmet need across all games).

#### Layout

```
├─△──●──△────△─────△──────────────────────────────────────┤
  ⚔     ⚔🏠  ⚔⚔   🏠
```

- **Horizontal progress bar** spanning the full width of the transport area
- **Playhead** (●) shows current position; draggable
- **Event markers** (△) appear as small icons above the bar at their timestamp
- **Engagement zones** shown as colored intensity bands behind the bar (SC2 combat shading pattern)
- **Time display:** `elapsed / total` in `mm:ss` format (or `--:--` in spoiler-free mode)

#### Event Markers

Auto-generated from the analysis event stream (see `05-FORMATS.md` § Analysis Events):

| Marker | Icon | Source Event |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Unit destroyed (significant)** | ⚔ | `UnitDestroyed` (filtered to non-trivial: hero units, expensive units, first blood) |
| **Base structure destroyed** | 🏠 | `ConstructionDestroyed` for production/defense buildings |
| **Tech transition** | ▲ | `UpgradeCompleted` for tier-changing upgrades |
| **Expansion established** | ◆ | `ConstructionCompleted` for resource structures at new locations |
| **Engagement zone** | Colored band | Clusters of `UnitDestroyed` events within a time window |
| **Player eliminated** | ☓ | `PlayerEliminated` / `MatchEnded` for that player |
| **Bookmark (user)** | 🔖 | User-placed via `Ctrl+B` |

#### Contextual Highlighting (LoL Pattern)

When the viewer locks camera to a specific player:

- That player's event markers **brighten** on the timeline
- Other players' markers **fade** (not hidden — just reduced opacity)
- This makes "find my kills" or "find my losses" effortless without separate filtering UI

#### Spoiler-Free Mode

**No game surveyed offers this.** IC can be first.

When enabled (toggle in replay menu or Settings → Gameplay):

- Total duration display shows `--:--` instead of the actual end time
- Timeline bar renders as an **expanding bar** that only shows the elapsed portion (the unplayed portion is hidden, not greyed out)
- Event markers only appear for already-viewed portions
- The progress bar does not reveal how much game remains

```
Spoiler-Free ON:
├─△──●──△────△─                                           │
  ⚔     ⚔🏠  ⚔⚔   ← bar ends at playhead; future is hidden
                    12:34 / --:--

Spoiler-Free OFF (default):
├─△──●──△────△─────△──────────────────────────────────────┤
  ⚔     ⚔🏠  ⚔⚔   🏠                    12:34 / 38:21
```

**Default:** Spoiler-free is **off** by default (most users want the full timeline). The setting persists across sessions.

---

### Camera Modes

Six camera modes, selectable via the camera bar or hotkeys:

| Mode | Key | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Free Camera** | `F` | Default. Pan (edge scroll / middle-click drag / WASD), zoom (scroll wheel), minimap click to jump. Standard RTS observer camera. |
| **Player Perspective** | `1`–`8` | Lock to a specific player's recorded camera position, scroll, and zoom. Shows what the player actually saw during the game. Selected units shown with dashed circles in player color (SC2 pattern). |
| **Follow Unit** | `Ctrl+F` on selected unit | Camera tracks a selected unit, keeping it centered. Useful for following hero units, harvesters, scouts. Click elsewhere or press `F` to exit. |
| **Directed Camera** | `D` | AI-controlled camera that automatically follows the action. Jumps between engagements, expansions, and production events. Useful for passive viewing and casting. Configurable aggression (how quickly it cuts between events). |
| **Drone Follow** | `Ctrl+D` | Loosely attached camera that follows the action with inertia and smooth movement. Cinematic feel without sharp cuts. (Fortnite drone-attach pattern adapted for isometric RTS.) |
| **All Vision** | `0` | Free camera with fog/shroud disabled for all players. Shows the full map state. |

#### Vision / Fog-of-War Controls

Dropdown in the camera bar:

| Option | Key | Effect |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **All Players (Combined)** | `-` | See the union of all players' vision |
| **Disable Shroud** | `=` | Full map revealed, including cloaked/hidden units |
| **Player 1 Vision** | `Shift+1` | See only what Player 1 can see |
| **Player 2 Vision** | `Shift+2` | See only what Player 2 can see |
| ... | `Shift+N` | Per-player fog-of-war |

**Ghost View (analysis mode):** `Ctrl+=` — Full map revealed, but units outside the selected player's vision are shown as translucent ghosts. Useful for studying opponent movements you couldn't see during the game. (Adapted from CS2 X-ray concept for RTS.)

---

### Observer Overlay Panels

Hotkey-toggled panels in the right sidebar. Each panel is independently toggleable and shows real-time data for all players. Design follows SC2's proven model — the most praised RTS observer system across all games surveyed.

| Panel | Key | Content |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **Army** | `A` | Per-player army composition: unit type icons with counts and total army value (resource cost of living military units). Color-coded by player. |
| **Production** | `P` | Per-player active build queues: what each player is currently building (units, structures, upgrades) with progress bars. |
| **Economy** | `E` | Per-player resource counts: credits on hand, income rate ($/min), harvester count, refinery count. |
| **Powers** | `W` | Per-player support power status: available/recharging/locked. Timer bars for recharging powers. |
| **Score** | `S` | Per-player score breakdown: Units Destroyed value, Units Lost value, Structures Destroyed, Structures Lost. |
| **APM** | `M` | Per-player Actions Per Minute: current window APM and game-average APM. Bar graph or sparkline. |

#### Panel Display Modes

Three display density options (CoH3 pattern):

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Expanded** | Full panel detail with all data visible | Learning, analysis |
| **Compact** | Condensed single-line-per-player summary | Experienced viewers wanting viewport space |
| **Caster** | Side-by-side team comparison layout, minimal chrome | Broadcast / streaming |

Toggle with `Tab` to cycle modes, or select from replay settings.

#### Larger Broadcast Panels (SC2 `Ctrl+` Pattern)

For tournament broadcasts and streaming, larger center-screen panels:

| Key | Panel |
|-----|-------|
| `Ctrl+A` | Large Army + Worker supply comparison |
| `Ctrl+E` | Large Income comparison |
| `Ctrl+S` | Large Score comparison |
| `Ctrl+N` | Player Name banners (name, faction, team color) |

These overlay the center-top of the viewport and auto-hide after 5 seconds (or on any key press). Designed for broadcast transitions.

---

### Graphs and Analysis Overlays

Available via the [Summary] button or during playback as overlay panels:

#### Timeline Graphs (SC2 Game Summary Pattern)

| Graph | Content | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Army Value** | Total military resource cost per player over time | Engagement zones shown as colored bands where army value drops sharply |
| **Income** | Per-minute harvesting rate per player over time | Shows economic advantage shifts |
| **Unspent Resources** | Credits on hand per player over time | High unspent = floating resources (coaching signal) |
| **Workers** | Harvester count per player over time | Economic investment tracking |
| **APM** | Actions Per Minute per player over time | Activity patterns and fatigue |

Graphs are clickable — click a point on any graph to jump the replay to that timestamp.

#### Build Order Timeline

Side-by-side per-player build order timeline showing:

- Unit and structure production events as icons on a horizontal time axis
- Upgrade completions marked with arrows
- Gap periods visible (idle production = coaching signal)

#### Heatmaps (Analysis Mode)

Accessible via [Summary] → Heatmaps tab:

| Heatmap | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Unit Death** | Where units died on the map (red = high density) |
| **Combat** | Where engagements occurred (intensity = resource cost traded) |
| **Camera Attention** | Where the player's camera spent time (from `CameraPositionSample` events at 2 Hz) |
| **Economy** | Where harvesters operated (resource field usage patterns) |

Heatmaps render as semi-transparent overlays on the minimap or full viewport.

---

### Replay Bookmarks

Users can mark moments for later reference:

- **Add bookmark:** `Ctrl+B` at current playhead position
- **Name bookmark:** Optional text label (default: `Bookmark at mm:ss`)
- **Navigate:** `←` / `→` to jump between bookmarks and event markers
- **Bookmark list:** Accessible via the replay menu; shows timestamp + label for each
- **Persistent:** Bookmarks are saved alongside the replay file (in a sidecar `.icrep.bookmarks` JSON file, not modifying the replay itself)

---

### Voice Playback

If voice was recorded during the match (opt-in per D059 consent model):

- **Per-player voice tracks** toggle in the transport bar: `[Voice ▾]` dropdown lists each player's name with a checkbox
- Voice tracks are Opus-encoded, aligned to game ticks
- **Mute/unmute** individual players without affecting others
- **Volume slider** per track (accessible from dropdown)
- Voice playback automatically syncs with replay speed (pitch-corrected at 2x; muted above 4x)

---

### Post-Game Summary Screen

Accessible from:
- Post-Game → [Summary] (after a live match)
- Replay Viewer → [Summary] button (during or after replay playback)
- Replay Browser → right-click → [View Summary]

The summary screen does **not** require replaying the match — it reads from the analysis event stream embedded in the `.icrep` file.

### Replay Sharing

#### Match ID System (Dota 2 Pattern)

Relay-hosted matches generate a unique **Match ID** (short alphanumeric hash, e.g., `IC-7K3M9X`). Any player can enter this ID in the replay browser to download the replay.

- **Copy Match ID:** Available in post-game screen, replay browser detail panel, and profile match history
- **[Enter Match ID...]** in replay browser: text field → download from relay → add to local library
- **URL format:** `ic://replay/IC-7K3M9X` — opens IC directly to the replay (OS URL scheme handler)
- **Availability:** Relay-hosted replays persist for a configurable period (default: 90 days, server-operator configurable via D072). After expiry, only locally-saved copies remain.
- **Privacy:** Match IDs for ranked games are public by default. Custom/private games generate IDs only if the host enables sharing.

#### File-Based Sharing

- `.icrep` files are portable and self-describing
- **Embedded resources mode** (see `05-FORMATS.md`): Self-contained replays that include the map and rule snapshots, so the recipient does not need matching content installed
- **File association:** `.icrep` registered with the OS; double-click opens IC's replay viewer
- **Drag-and-drop:** Drop an `.icrep` file onto the IC window to open it

#### Workshop Integration

- Community replays can be published to the Workshop as curated collections (e.g., "Best Games of Season 3", "Teaching Replays: Soviet Openings")
- Workshop replay packs include metadata for browsing without downloading every replay file
- Creators can attach commentary notes to published replays

### Video / Clip Export

**IC ships with built-in `.webm` video export** — ahead of every RTS surveyed except LoL's basic clip system.

#### Quick Clip

During replay playback:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` or click [Clip] to start recording
2. The transport bar shows a red recording indicator and elapsed clip time
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` again to stop
4. Clip saved to `Replays/Clips/` as `.webm` (VP9 video + Opus audio)
5. Toast notification: `Clip saved (12s) — [Open Folder] [Copy to Clipboard]`

#### Full Replay Export

From replay browser or viewer menu: [Export Video...]

```

**Render pipeline:** The export runs the replay at accelerated speed off-screen, capturing frames to the encoder. This allows higher-quality output than screen capture and works headless.

### Cinematic Camera Tools

For content creators and community filmmakers. Accessible via replay viewer menu → [Cinematic Mode] or `Ctrl+Shift+C`.

#### Camera Path Editor

Define a camera path with keyframes:

- Place keyframes at positions along the timeline (`Ctrl+K` to add keyframe at current camera position and tick)
- Each keyframe stores: camera position, zoom, rotation (for 3D render mode), playback speed at that point
- Camera interpolates smoothly between keyframes (Catmull-Rom spline)
- Preview the path before recording
- Export the camera path as a reusable `.iccam` file

#### Lens Controls (3D Render Mode, D048)

When using 3D render mode:

| Control | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Focal Length** | Wide-angle to telephoto (adjustable slider) |
| **Aperture** | Depth-of-field blur amount (lower = more bokeh) |
| **Auto Focus** | Toggle; when off, manual focus distance slider |

#### Cinematic Toggles

| Toggle | Key | Effect |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **Hide all UI** | `Ctrl+Shift+H` | Remove all overlays, transport bar, panels — clean game viewport only |
| **Hide player names** | | Remove floating player/unit names |
| **Hide health bars** | | Remove health/selection indicators |
| **Letterbox** | | Add cinematic black bars (21:9 crop on 16:9 display) |

---

### Moddable Observer UI

The observer overlay system is **data-driven and moddable** (SC2 custom observer UI pattern). Community creators can publish custom observer layouts via the Workshop.

- Observer panel layouts are defined in YAML (position, size, data bindings, conditional visibility)
- The game provides a standardized data API that observer panels read from (player stats, army composition, economy, production, APM)
- Built-in layouts: `Default`, `Compact`, `Caster Broadcast`
- Workshop layouts installable and selectable from replay viewer settings
- Layout switching is instant (no reload required)

This enables community-created broadcast overlays (equivalent to SC2's WCS Observer and AhliObs) without engine modifications.

### Live Spectator Mode

Live spectating shares the same viewer infrastructure as replay playback, with these differences:

| Feature | Replay Viewer | Live Spectator |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Transport controls | Full (seek, rewind, speed) | Play only; no rewind/seek (live stream) |
| Speed | 0.25x–8x + Max | Real-time only |
| Broadcast delay | N/A | Configurable (default 120s for ranked/tournament) |
| Observer panels | All available | All available |
| Camera modes | All six | All six |
| Voice | Recorded tracks | Live voice (if spectator permitted) |
| Join timing | Any time (file is complete) | Must join before match or during (mid-game join supported via relay snapshot) |
| Chat | N/A (replay has no live chat) | Observer chat channel (separate from player chat — anti-coaching per D059) |

#### Mid-Game Spectator Join

Unlike OpenRA (which cannot do this), IC's relay architecture supports spectators joining a match in progress:

1. Spectator requests join via relay
2. Relay sends current state snapshot + recent order backlog
3. Client re-simulates from snapshot to catch up
4. Spectator enters live stream with <5 second catch-up delay

#### Spectator Slots

- Visible in lobby with spectator count / max slots
- Separate from player slots
- Lobby host configures: max spectators, fog-of-war policy, broadcast delay
- Tournament mode: spectator slots may require organizer approval

### Foreign Replay Playback (D056)

Imported replays (OpenRA `.orarep`, Remastered Collection) play through the same viewer with additional UX:

#### Divergence Confidence Indicator

A small badge in the transport bar shows the current divergence confidence level:

| Level | Badge | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Plausible** | Green ✓ | Replay is tracking well; no detectable divergence |
| **Minor Drift** | Yellow ⚠ | Small state differences detected; visuals may differ slightly from the original |
| **Diverged** | Red ✗ | Significant divergence; replay may not accurately represent the original match |

The badge is clickable to show a detail panel with divergence metrics and explanation.

#### Limitations Banner

Foreign replays show a subtle top banner on first load:

```
This replay was imported from {OpenRA / Remastered}. Playback uses translated
orders and may differ from the original. [Learn More] [Dismiss]
```

---

### Replay Anonymization

`ic replay anonymize <file>` (CLI) or Replay Browser → right-click → [Anonymize...]:

- Replace player names with generic labels (`Player 1`, `Player 2`, etc.)
- Strip voice tracks
- Strip chat messages
- Preserve all gameplay data (orders, events, state hashes)
- Useful for educational content sharing, tournament review, and privacy

---

### Replay Settings

Accessible via [Settings] gear icon in the transport bar:

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Spoiler-free mode** | On / Off | Off |
| **Rewind jump duration** | 5s / 10s / 15s / 30s | 15s |
| **Auto-record all games** | On / Off | On |
| **Default camera mode** | Free / Directed / Player 1 | Free |
| **Default observer panel** | None / Army / Economy / Score | None |
| **Panel display density** | Expanded / Compact / Caster | Expanded |
| **Event marker density** | All / Significant Only / Off | Significant Only |
| **Voice playback default** | All On / All Off / Per-Player | All On |
| **Observer UI layout** | Default / Compact / Caster / Custom | Default |

---

### Platform Adaptations

| Platform | Adaptation |
|----------|-----------|
| **Desktop (KBM)** | Full hotkey set; all features accessible |
| **Gamepad / Steam Deck** | Transport controls on D-pad; camera on sticks; panels on shoulder buttons; radial menu for camera modes |
| **Touch (Tablet)** | Swipe timeline to scrub; pinch to zoom; tap event markers to jump; floating transport buttons; panels in collapsible drawer |
| **Phone** | Simplified overlay with one panel at a time; timeline at bottom with large touch targets; speed control via tap zones |

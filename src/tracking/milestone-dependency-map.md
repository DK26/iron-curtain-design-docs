# Milestone Dependency Map (Execution Overlay)

Keywords: milestone dag, dependency graph, critical path, feature clusters, roadmap overlay, implementation order, hard dependency, soft dependency

> This page is the **detailed dependency companion** to [`../18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md`](../18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md). It does not replace [`../08-ROADMAP.md`](../08-ROADMAP.md); it translates roadmap phases and accepted decisions into an implementation-oriented milestone DAG and feature-cluster dependency map.

## Purpose

Use this page to answer:

- What blocks what?
- What can run in parallel?
- Which milestone exits require which feature clusters?
- Which policy/legal gates block validation even if code exists?
- Where do `Dxxx` decisions land in implementation order?

## Dependency Edge Kinds (Canonical)

| Edge Kind | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hard_depends_on` | Cannot start meaningfully before predecessor exists | `M2` depends on `M1` (sim needs parsed rules + assets/render slice confidence) |
| `soft_depends_on` | Strongly preferred order; can parallelize with stubs | `M8` creator foundations benefit from `M3`, but can start after `M2` |
| `validation_depends_on` | Can prototype earlier, but cannot validate/exit without predecessor | `M7` anti-cheat moderation UX can prototype before full signed replay chain, but validation depends on D052/D007 evidence |
| `enables_parallel_work` | Unlocks a new independent lane | `M2` enables `M8` creator foundation lane |
| `policy_gate` | Legal/governance/security prerequisite | DMCA agent registration before validating full Workshop upload ops |
| `integration_gate` | Feature exists but must integrate with another system before milestone exit | D069 setup wizard + D068 selective install + D049 package verification before “ready” maintenance flow is considered complete |

## Milestone DAG Summary (Canonical Shape)

```text
M0 -> M1 -> M2 -> M3
               ├-> M4 (minimal online slice)
               ├-> M8 (creator foundation lane)
               └-> M5 -> M6

M4 + M6 -> M7
M7 + M8 -> M9
M9 -> M10
M7 + M10 -> M11
```

## Milestone Nodes (M0–M11)

| Milestone | Objective | Maps to Roadmap | `hard_depends_on` | `soft_depends_on` | Unlocks / Enables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `M0` | Tracker + execution overlay baseline | Pre-phase docs/process | — | — | `M1` planning clarity |
| `M1` | Resource/format fidelity + rendering slice | Phase 0 + Phase 1 | `M0` | — | `M2` |
| `M2` | Deterministic sim + replayable combat slice | Phase 2 | `M1` | — | `M3`, `M4`, `M5`, `M8` |
| `M3` | Local playable skirmish | Phase 3 + Phase 4 prep | `M2` | — | `M4`, `M5`, `M6` |
| `M4` | Minimal online skirmish (no tracker/ranked) | Phase 5 subset | `M3` | `M5` (parallel) | `M7` |
| `M5` | Campaign runtime vertical slice | Phase 4 subset | `M3` | `M4` (parallel) | `M6` |
| `M6` | Full campaigns + SP maturity | Phase 4 full | `M5` | `M4` | `M7` |
| `M7` | Multiplayer productization | Phase 5 full | `M4`, `M6` | — | `M9`, `M11` |
| `M8` | Creator foundation (CLI + minimal Workshop) | Phase 4–5 overlay + 6a foundation | `M2` | `M3`, `M4` | `M9` |
| `M9` | Scenario editor core + full Workshop + OpenRA export core | Phase 6a | `M7`, `M8` | — | `M10` |
| `M10` | Campaign editor + modes + RA1 export + ext. | Phase 6b | `M9` | — | `M11` |
| `M11` | Ecosystem polish + optional AI/LLM + platform breadth | Phase 7 | `M7`, `M10` | — | Ongoing product evolution |

## Critical Path Table (Recommended Baseline)

| Order | Milestone | Why It Is On the Critical Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `M1` | Without format/resource fidelity and rendering confidence, sim correctness and game-feel validation are blind |
| 2 | `M2` | Deterministic simulation is the core dependency for skirmish, campaign, and multiplayer |
| 3 | `M3` | First playable local loop is the gateway to meaningful online and campaign runtime validation |
| 4 | `M4` | Minimal online slice proves the netcode architecture in real conditions before productization |
| 5 | `M5` | Campaign runtime slice de-risks the continuous flow/campaign graph stack |
| 6 | `M6` | Full campaign completeness is a differentiator and prerequisite for final multiplayer-vs-campaign prioritization decisions |
| 7 | `M7` | Ranked/trust/browser/spectator/community infra depend on both mature runtime and online vertical slice learnings |
| 8 | `M8` | Creator foundation can parallelize, but `M9` cannot exit without it |
| 9 | `M9` | Scenario editor + full Workshop + export core unlock the authoring platform promise |
| 10 | `M10` | Campaign editor and advanced templates mature the content platform |
| 11 | `M11` | Optional AI/LLM and platform polish should build on stabilized gameplay/multiplayer/editor foundations |

## Parallel Lanes (Planned)

| Lane | Start After | Primary Scope | Why Parallelizable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Lane A: Runtime Core` | `M1` | `M2 -> M3 -> M4` | Core engine and minimal netcode slice |
| `Lane B: Campaign Runtime` | `M3` | `M5 -> M6` | Reuses sim/game chrome while net productization proceeds |
| `Lane C: Creator Foundation` | `M2` | `M8` | CLI/minimal Workshop/profile foundations can advance without full visual editor |
| `Lane D: Multiplayer Productization` | `M4 + M6` | `M7` | Needs runtime and net slice maturity plus content/gameplay maturity |
| `Lane E: Authoring Platform` | `M7 + M8` | `M9 -> M10` | Depends on productized runtime/networking and creator infra |
| `Lane F: Optional AI/Polish` | `M7 + M10` | `M11` | Optional systems should not steal bandwidth from core delivery |

## Granular Foundational Execution Ladder (RA First Mission Loop -> Project Completion)

> This section refines the early critical path into a **build-order ladder** for the first playable Red Alert mission loop. It does not replace `M0–M11`; it decomposes the early milestones into implementation steps and then reconnects them to the milestone sequence through completion.

### A. First RA Mission Loop (Detailed Build Order, `M1–M3`)

| Step ID | Build Step (What to Implement) | Primary Milestone | Priority | Hard Depends On | Exit Artifact / Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `G2` | Bevy can load parsed map tiles/sprites and render a RA map scene correctly (camera + palette-correct sprite draw) | `M1` | `P-Core` | `G1` | Static map render slice (faithful map + sprite placement) |
| `G3` | Unit sprite animation playback baseline (idle/move/fire/death sequences) | `M1` | `P-Core` | `G2` | Animated units visible in rendered scene with correct sequence timing |
| `G4` | Input/cursor baseline in gameplay scene (cursor state changes, hover hit-test, click targeting primitives) | `M2` (early UI seam work) | `P-Core` | `G2` | Cursor + hover feedback working on entities/cells |
| `G5` | Unit selection baseline (single select, multi-select/box select minimum, selection markers) | `M2` (feeds `M3`) | `P-Core` | `G4`, `G3` | Selectable units with visible selection feedback |
| `G6` | Deterministic sim tick loop + order application skeleton (`move`, `stop`, state transitions) | `M2` | `P-Core` | `G2`, `PG.P002.FIXED_POINT_SCALE` | Repeatable sim ticks with stable state hashes |
| `G7` | Pathfinder + spatial query baseline (`Pathfinder`/`SpatialIndex`) integrated into unit movement order execution | `M2` | `P-Core` | `G6`, `PG.P002.FIXED_POINT_SCALE` | Units can receive move orders and path around blockers deterministically |
| `G8` | Movement presentation sync (render follows sim state: facing/animation/state transitions) | `M2` | `P-Core` | `G7`, `G3` | Units visibly move correctly under player orders |
| `G9` | Combat baseline: targeting + projectile/hit resolution (or direct-fire hit pipeline for first slice) | `M2` | `P-Core` | `G7`, `G6` | Units can attack and reduce enemy health deterministically |
| `G10` | Death/destruction baseline (unit death state, removal, death animation/cleanup) | `M2` | `P-Core` | `G9`, `G3` | Combat kills units cleanly with deterministic removal |
| `G11` | Mission-state baseline: victory/failure evaluators (`all enemies dead`, `all player units dead`) | `M3` (mission loop UX) | `P-Core` | `G10`, `G6` | Win/loss condition fires from sim state, not UI heuristics |
| `G12` | Mission-end UX shell (`Mission Accomplished` / `Mission Failed` screens + flow pause/transition) | `M3` | `P-Core` | `G11`, `M3.UX.GAME_CHROME_CORE` | Mission-end screen appears with correct result and blocks/resumes flow correctly |
| `G13` | EVA/VO mission-end audio integration (`Mission Accomplished` / `Mission Failed`) | `M3` | `P-Core` | `G12`, `M3.CORE.AUDIO_EVA_MUSIC`, `PG.P003.AUDIO_LIBRARY` | Correct VO plays on mission result with no duplicate/late triggers |
| `G14` | Minimal mission restart/exit loop (replay same mission / return to menu) | `M3` | `P-Core` | `G12` | First complete single-mission play loop (start -> play -> end -> replay/exit) |
| `G15` | RA “feel” pass for first mission loop (cursor feedback, selection readability, audio timing, result pacing) | `M3` | `P-Core` | `G14`, `G13` | Internal playtest says “recognizably RA-like” for mission loop baseline |
| `G16` | Promote to `M3` skirmish path by widening from fixed mission slice to local skirmish loop + basic AI subset (`D043`) | `M3` | `P-Core` | `G15`, `M3.CORE.GAP_P1_GAMEPLAY_SYSTEMS`, `M3.CORE.GAP_P2_SKIRMISH_FAMILIARITY` | Local skirmish playable milestone exit (`M3.SP.SKIRMISH_LOCAL_LOOP`) |

### A.1 `G1.x` Substeps (Owned-Source Import/Extract Foundations, `M1` -> `M3` Handoff)

| Substep | Build Step (What to Implement) | Primary Milestone | Priority | Hard Depends On | Exit Artifact / Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `G1.1` | Source-adapter probe contract + source-manifest snapshot schema (Steam/GOG/EA/manual/Remastered normalized probe output) | `M1` | `P-Core` | `G1` | Probe fixtures + source-manifest snapshot examples match D069 setup expectations |
| `G1.2` | `.mix` extraction primitives for importer staging (enumerate, validate entries, extract without source mutation) | `M1` | `P-Core` | `G1.1` | `.mix` extraction corpus tests + corrupt-entry handling assertions |
| `G1.3` | `.shp/.pal` importer-ready validation and parser-to-render handoff metadata | `M1` | `P-Core` | `G1.2`, `G2` | Validation fixtures + palette/sprite handoff smoke tests for render slice |
| `G1.4` | `.aud/.vqa` header/chunk integrity validation and importer result diagnostics (pre-playback checks) | `M1` | `P-Core` | `G1.2` | Import diagnostics distinguish valid/invalid media payloads with actionable reasons |
| `G1.5` | Importer artifact outputs (source manifest snapshots, per-item results, provenance, retry/re-scan metadata) | `M3` | `P-Core` | `G1.1`, `M1.CORE.DATA_DIR_AND_PORTABILITY_BASE` | Import artifact samples align with `05-FORMATS` owned-source import pipeline and D069 repair flows |
| `G1.6` | Remastered Collection source adapter probe + normalized importer handoff (out-of-the-box D069 import path) | `M3` | `P-Core` | `G1.5`, `M3.CORE.PROPRIETARY_ASSET_IMPORT_AND_EXTRACT` | D069 setup demo imports Remastered assets without manual conversion or source-install mutation |

### B. Continuation Chain After the First Mission Loop (Milestone-Level, Through Completion)

| Step ID | Next Logical Step | Primary Milestone | Priority | Hard Depends On | Why This Is Next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `G17` | Minimal online skirmish slice (relay/direct connect, no tracker/ranked) | `M4` | `P-Core` | `G16`, `M2.CORE.SNAPSHOT_HASH_REPLAY_BASE` | Proves finalized netcode architecture in the smallest real deployment slice |
| `G18` | Campaign runtime vertical slice (briefing -> mission -> debrief -> next mission) | `M5` | `P-Differentiator` | `G16`, `M5.SP.LUA_MISSION_RUNTIME` | Proves campaign graph/runtime flow before scaling campaign content |
| `G19` | Full campaign correctness/completeness (Allied/Soviet + media fallback-safe flow) | `M6` | `P-Differentiator` | `G18` | Delivers the campaign-first product promise and stabilizes SP maturity |
| `G20` | Multiplayer productization (browser, ranked, trust labels, reports/review, spectator) | `M7` | `P-Differentiator` / `P-Scale` | `G17`, `G19`, `PG.P004.LOBBY_WIRE_DETAILS` | Expands “it works online” into a trustworthy multiplayer product |
| `G21` | Creator foundation lane (CLI + minimal Workshop + profiles/namespace) | `M8` | `P-Creator` | `M2` (can run in parallel before `G20`) | Reduces creator-loop friction without waiting for full SDK |
| `G22` | Scenario editor core + full Workshop + OpenRA export core | `M9` | `P-Creator` | `G20`, `G21` | Delivers the first full creator-platform promise |
| `G23` | Campaign editor + advanced game modes + RA1 export + editor extensibility | `M10` | `P-Creator` / `P-Differentiator` | `G22` | Enables advanced authored experiences and D070-family mode tooling |
| `G24` | Ecosystem polish + optional BYOLLM + visual/render-mode expansion + platform breadth | `M11` | `P-Optional` / `P-Scale` | `G20`, `G23` | Keeps optional/polish systems after core gameplay/multiplayer/editor foundations are stable |

### C. Dependency Notes for the First Mission Loop (Non-Obvious Blockers)

- **`PG.P002.FIXED_POINT_SCALE` is a hard gate before `G6/G7/G9`.**
  - Do not start serious sim/path/combat implementation before this is resolved.
- **`PG.P003.AUDIO_LIBRARY` is a hard gate before `G13` and a practical gate before `G15`.**
  - You can prototype mission-end UI (`G12`) before audio is finalized.
- **`M3` AI scope must be frozen before `G16`.**
  - Use the documented “dummy/basic AI baseline” subset from `D043`; do not pull full `M6` AI sophistication into the `M3` exit.
- **`G11` mission-end evaluators should be implemented as sim-derived logic, then surfaced through UI (`G12`).**
  - Prevents UI-side win/loss heuristics from diverging from the authoritative state model.
- **`G17` online slice must keep strict `M4` boundaries.**
  - No tracker browser, no ranked queue, no broad community infra assumptions in the `M4` exit.

### D. Campaign Execution Ladder (Campaign Runtime Slice -> Full Campaign Completeness, `M5–M6`)

| `G17.3` | Minimal online skirmish end-to-end play (complete match, result, disconnect cleanly) | `M4` | `P-Core` | `G17.2`, `G16` | `M4.NET.MINIMAL_LOCKSTEP_ONLINE` exit proven in real play sessions |
| `G17.4` | Reconnect baseline decision and implementation or explicit defer contract (with user-facing wording) | `M4` | `P-Core` | `G17.3`, `D010` | Reconnect works in the documented baseline **or** defer contract is locked and reflected in UX/docs |
| `G20.1` | Tracking/browser discovery + trust labels + lobby listings | `M7` | `P-Differentiator` | `G17.3`, `G19`, `D052` baseline infrastructure | Browser-based discoverability works with correct trust label semantics |

| `G21.2a` | Owned-source import verify/retry diagnostics (distinct from Workshop package verify path) | `M8` | `P-Creator` | `G21.2`, `G21.1a` | Diagnostics output separates source probe/import/extract/index failures with recovery steps |
| `G21.3a` | Repair/re-scan/re-extract tooling for owned-source imports (maintenance parity with D069) | `M8` | `P-Creator` | `G21.3`, `G21.2a` | CLI maintenance flows recover moved installs/stale indexes without mutating source installs |
| `G21.4a` | Generated docs for import modes + format-by-format importer behavior (one-source pipeline from `05-FORMATS`) | `M8` | `P-Creator` | `G21.4`, `G21.3a` | Creator docs pipeline publishes importer/extractor reference used by SDK help later |
| `G22.1` | Scenario Editor core (`D038`) + validate/test/publish loop + resource manager basics | `M9` | `P-Creator` | `G20.5`, `G21.3` | Scenario authoring works end-to-end using real runtime/test flows |

| `G24.3` | Visual/render-mode infrastructure expansion (`D048`) + platform breadth polish (browser/mobile/Deck) | `M11` | `P-Optional` / `P-Scale` | `G20.5`, `G23.3`, `D017` baseline | `M11` exit: optional visual/platform breadth work lands without breaking low-end baseline |

### G. Cross-Lane Sequencing Rules (Completion Planning Guardrails)

- **Do not start `G22.*` (full visual SDK/editor platform) before `G20.5` + `G21.3`.**
  - This prevents editor semantics and content schemas from outrunning runtime/network/product foundations.
- **`G21.*` is intentionally parallelizable after `M2`, but `G22.*` is not.**
  - Early creator CLI/workshop foundations reduce rework; full visual SDK needs stabilized runtime semantics.
- **`G24.*` remains optional/polish unless explicitly promoted by a new decision and overlay remap.**
  - `M11` should not displace unfinished `M7–M10` exit criteria.

| `research/rtl-bidi-open-source-implementation-study.md` | RTL correctness requires shaping + BiDi + role-aware font fallback + selective layout direction policy (not font coverage alone), plus explicit D059 anti-spoof vs legitimate RTL split | `M6.UX.RTL_BIDI_GAME_UI_BASELINE`, `M7.UX.D059_RTL_CHAT_MARKER_TEXT_SAFETY`, `M7.UX.D059_BEACONS_MARKERS_LABELS`, `M9.SDK.RTL_BASIC_EDITOR_UI_LAYOUT`, `M10.SDK.RTL_BIDI_LOCALIZATION_WORKBENCH_PREVIEW`, `M10.SDK.LOCALIZATION_PLUGIN_HARDENING`, `M11.PLAT.BROWSER_MOBILE_POLISH` | Localization/UX correctness hardening + test emphasis | Prevents "Unicode glyph coverage" false positives and keeps runtime/editor/chat RTL behavior aligned before localization claims scale |
| `research/source-sdk-2013-source-study.md` | Fixed-point determinism validated: Source's float prediction requires NaN checks, bit-level comparison, platform-specific friction, and runtime divergence logging — all eliminated by `i32`/`i64` | `M2.CORE.SIM_FIXED_POINT_AND_ORDERS`, `M0.QA.CI_PIPELINE_FOUNDATION` | Architecture validation (no milestone shift) | Strongest empirical evidence for fixed-point math decision; Source's `CDiffManager` concept maps to IC's CI-grade determinism test |
| `research/source-sdk-2013-source-study.md` | Safe parsing validated: every major Source CVE (buffer overflow, integer underflow, path traversal) is in C/C++ content parsing code that Rust prevents at compile time | `M1.CORE.RA_FORMATS_PARSE`, `M0.QA.CI_PIPELINE_FOUNDATION` | Security validation + fuzz emphasis | Reinforces no-`unsafe`-in-content-pipeline rule and fuzz testing priority for `ra-formats`, YAML, replay, and network parsers |

## Mapping Rules (How to Keep This Page Useful)

1. **Cluster-level, not bullet-level sprawl:** map roadmap deliverables and exit criteria into stable feature clusters unless a bullet is itself a dependency boundary.
2. **Dxxx ownership lives in `18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md`:** this page references decisions at cluster level for dependency reasoning.
3. **Gameplay familiarity ordering follows `11-OPENRA-FEATURES.md`:** `P0` gates `M2`, `P1/P2` gate `M3`, `P3` is explicitly deferred and tracked.
4. **Mark policy/legal prerequisites as `policy_gate` nodes, not hidden assumptions.**
5. **Keep the “minimal online slice” narrow:** `M4` must not absorb browser/ranked/spectator requirements.
6. **Keep “creator foundation” distinct from “full visual editor”:** `M8` is a parallel lane, `M9` is the visual authoring platform milestone.
7. **New features must be inserted in sequence, not appended as unsorted TODOs:** every accepted feature proposal gets a milestone position and dependency edges in the same planning pass.
8. **Priority is mandatory for placement decisions:** new clusters should be classified (`P-Core`, `P-Differentiator`, `P-Creator`, `P-Scale`, `P-Optional`) and placed so higher-priority critical-path work is not silently displaced.
9. **If a feature spans multiple milestones, split the cluster or add explicit `validation_depends_on` / `integration_gate` edges** instead of hiding sequencing inside notes.
10. **If non-indexed decision references reappear, normalize the decision index in the same planning pass** and update tracker coverage.
11. **When a source study yields accepted implementation refinements, map them here** (cluster references + action type) so they influence execution planning instead of living only in `research/*.md`.
12. **Future/deferred wording in canonical docs must map here when it implies accepted work.** If a statement is a planned deferral, add/update the affected cluster row (or create one) in the same planning pass and update `tracking/future-language-audit.md`; if it cannot be placed, it is proposal-only or a `Pxxx`, not scheduled work.
13. **If accepted work changes external implementation-repo onboarding or code navigation expectations, update the bootstrap and template docs** (`tracking/external-code-project-bootstrap.md`, `tracking/external-project-agents-template.md`, `tracking/source-code-index-template.md`) in the same planning pass.

## New Feature Intake (Dependency Map Workflow)

Use this workflow whenever a new feature/mode/tooling surface is added to the design:

1. **Decide whether it is a `Dxxx` decision, a feature cluster, or both.**
2. **Assign a primary milestone** (`M0–M11`) based on what must exist before the feature becomes implementable.
3. **Add hard/soft/validation/policy/integration edges** to existing milestones/clusters.
4. **Record the canonical docs + roadmap phase mapping** in the cluster row.
5. **Check for milestone displacement:** if the feature would delay a higher-priority milestone, mark it `P-Optional`/experimental or move it later.
6. **Update `18-PROJECT-TRACKER.md` in the same change set** (milestone snapshot/risk/coverage impact and Dxxx row if applicable).
7. **If the feature docs introduce future/deferred wording, classify it and update `tracking/future-language-audit.md`** (and use `tracking/deferral-wording-patterns.md` for replacement wording where needed).
8. **If the feature changes expected codebase structure or implementer routing, update the external bootstrap/AGENTS/code-index templates** so external repos inherit the same assumptions.

### Deferred Feature Placement Examples (Canonical Patterns)

- **Good (planned deferral):** "Deferred to `M10` (`P-Creator`) after `M9.SDK.D038_SCENARIO_EDITOR_CORE`; not part of `M9` exit criteria."  
  Result: add/update an `M10.*` cluster row with hard/soft edges and note the out-of-scope boundary.
- **Good (north star):** "Long-term vision only; depends on `M7.NET.CROSS_ENGINE_BRIDGE_AND_TRUST` + `M11.VISUAL.D048_AND_RENDER_MOD_INFRA`; trust-labeled and not a ranked promise."  
  Result: no new cluster if already covered, but add/update tracker risk/trust-label notes.
- **Bad (ambiguous):** "Could add later if players want it."  
  Result: rewrite into planned deferral + overlay mapping, or mark proposal-only / `Pxxx`.
- **Good (external implementation handoff):** "This introduces a new first-class subsystem boundary; update `CODE-INDEX.md` template examples and external `AGENTS.md` guidance in `M0` tooling docs."
  Result: preserve LLM/human navigation quality across implementation repos as the architecture grows.
